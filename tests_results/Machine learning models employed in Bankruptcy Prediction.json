This paper proposes three relatively newly-developed methods for predicting bankruptcy based on real-life data. The result shows among the methods (support vector machine, neural network with dropout, autoencoder), neural network with added layers with dropout has the highest accuracy. And a comparison with the former methods (logistic regression, genetic algorithm, inductive learning) shows higher accuracy.\n\nKeywords\n\nSupport Vector Machine, Autoencoder, Neural Network, Bankruptcy, Machine Learning\n\nShare and Cite:\n\n1. Introduction\n\nMachine learning is a subfield of computer science. It allows computers to build analytical models of data and find hidden insights automatically, without being unequivocally coded. It has been applied to a variety of aspects in modern society, ranging from DNA sequences classification, credit card fraud detection, robot locomotion, to natural language processing. It can be used to solve many types of tasks such as classification. Bankruptcy prediction is a typical example of classification problems.\n\nMachine learning was born from pattern recognition. Earlier works of the same topic (machine learning in bankruptcy) use models including logistic regression, genetic algorithm, and inductive learning.\n\nLogistic regression is a statistical method allowing researchers to build predictive function based on a sample. This model is best used for understanding how several independent variables influence a single outcome variable [1] . Though useful in some ways, logistic regression is also limited.\n\nGenetic algorithm is based on natural selection and evolution. It can be used to extract rules in propositional and first-order logic, and to choose the appropriate sets of if-then rules for complicated classification problems [2] .\n\nInductive learning’s main category is decision tree algorithm. It identifies training data or earlier knowledge patterns and then extracts generalized rules which are then used in problem solving [2] .\n\nTo see if the accuracy of bankruptcy prediction can be further improved, we propose three latest models―support vector machine (SVM), neural network, and autoencoder.\n\nSupport vector machine is a supervised learning method which is especially effective in cases of high dimensions, and is memory efficient because it uses a subset of training points in the decision function. Also, it specifies kernel functions according to the decision function [3] . Its nice math property guarantees a simple convex optimization problem to converge to a single global problem.\n\nNeural networks, unlike conventional computers, are expressive models that learn by examples. They contain multiple hidden layers, thus are capable of learning very complicated relationships between inputs and outputs. And they operate significantly faster than conventional techniques. However, due to limited training data, overfitting will affect the ultimate accuracy. To prevent this, a technique called dropout―temporarily and randomly removes units (hidden and visible)―to the neural network [4] .\n\nAutoencoder, also known as Diabolo network, is an unsupervised learning algorithm that sets the target values to be equal to the inputs. By doing this, it suppresses the computation of representing a few functions, which improves accuracy. Also, the amount of training data required to learn these functions is reduced [5] .\n\nThis paper is structured as follows. Section 2 describes the motivation for this idea. Section 3 describes relevant previous work. Section 4 formally describes the three models. In Section 5 we present our experimental results where we do a parallel comparison within the three models we choose and a longitudinal comparison with the three older models. Section 6 is the conclusion. Section 7 is the reference.\n\n2. Motivation\n\nThe three models we choose (SVM, neural network, autoencoder) are relatively newly-developed but have already been applied to many fields.\n\nSVM has been used successfully in many real-world problems such as text categorization, object tracking, and bioinformatics (Protein classification, Cancer classification). Text categorization is especially helpful in daily life―web searching and email filtering provide huge convenience and work efficiency.\n\nNeural networks learn by examples instead of algorithms, thus, they have been widely applied to problems where it is hard or impossible to apply algorithmic methods [6] . For instance, finger print recognition is an exciting application. People can now use their unique fingerprints as keys to unlock their phones and payment accounts, free from the troubling, long passwords.\n\nAutoencoders are especially successful in solving difficult tasks like natural language processing (NLP). They have been used to solve the previous seemingly intractable problems in NLP, including word embeddings, machine translation, document clustering, sentiment analysis, and paraphrase detection.\n\nHowever, the usage of the three models in economics or finance is comparatively hard to find. So, we aim to find out if they still work well in economical field by running them with real-life data in a predicting bankruptcy task.\n\nAnother motivation is finding out if the accuracy of this particular problem (bankruptcy prediction) can be improved after reading previous works―The discovery of experts’ decision rules from qualitative bankruptcy data using genetic algorithms [2] , and Predicting Bankruptcy with Robust Logistic Regression [1] ―which uses older models. Thus, a comparison of the models and results is included in this paper.\n\n3. Related Work\n\nMachine learning enables computers to find insights from data automatically. The idea of using machine learning to predict bankruptcy has previously been used in the context of Predicting Bankruptcy with Robust Logistic Regression by Richard P. Hauser and David Booth [1] . This paper uses robust logistic regression which finds the maximum trimmed correlation between the samples remained after removing the overly large samples and the estimated model using logistic regression [1] . This model has its limitation. The value of this technique relies heavily on researchers’ abilities to include the correct independent variables. In other words, if researchers fail to identify all the relevant independent variables, logistic regression will have little predictive value [7] . Its overall accuracy is 75.69% in the training set and 69.44% in testing set.\n\nAnother work, the discovery of experts’ decision rules from qualitative bankruptcy data using genetic algorithms, in 2003 by Myoung-Jong Kim and Ingoo Han uses the same dataset as we do. They apply older models―inductive learning algorithms (decision tree), genetic algorithms, and neural networks without dropout. Since the length of genomes in GA is fixed, a given problem cannot easily be encoded. And GA gives no guarantee of finding the global maxima. The problem of inductive learning is with the one-step-ahead node splitting without backtracking, which may generate a suboptimal tree. Also, decision trees can be unstable because small variations in the data might result in a completely different tree being generated [3] . And the absence of dropout in the neural network model increases the possibility of overfitting which affects accuracy. The overall accuracies are 89.7%, 94.0%, and 90.3% respectively.\n\nThe models we choose either contain a newly developed technique, like dropout, or completely new models that have hardly been utilized in bankruptcy prediction.\n\n4. Model Description\n\nThis section describes the proposed three models.\n\n4.1. Support Vector Machine\n\nSpecifically, we use support vector classify (SVC), a subcategory of SVM, in this task. It constructs a hyper-plane, as shown in Figure 1, in a high dimensional space which is used for classification. Generally, a good separation represented by the solid line in Figure 1 means the distance(the space between the dotted lines) to the nearest training data points (the red and blue dots) of any class (represented by the color red and blue) is the largest. This is also known as functional margin [3] .\n\nWith training vectors in two classes and a vector,\n\nx\ni\n∈\nR\np\n,i=1,⋯,n, y∈\n{1,−1}\nn\n\nrespectively, SVM aims at solving the problem:\n\nmin\nω,b,ζ\n1\n2\nω\nT\nω+C\n∑\nn\ni=1\nζ\ni\n\nsubject to\n\ny\ni\n(\nω\nT\nϕ(\nx\ni\n)+b)≥1−\nζ\ni\n\nIts dual is\n\nmin\nα\n1\n2\nα\nT\nQα−\ne\nT\nα\n\nsubject to\n\ny\nT\nα=0,  0≤\nα\ni\n≤C, i=1,⋯,n\n\nwhere e is a common vector,\nC>0\nC\nis upper bound, Q is n by n positive semidefinite matrix,\nQ\nij\n≡\ny\ni\ny\nj\nk(\nx\ni\n⋅\nx\nj\n)\n, and\nK(\nx\ni\n,\nx\nj\n)=ϕ\n(\nx\ni\n)\nT\nϕ(\nx\nj\n)\nis the kernel.\n\nFigure 1. SVM model [3] .\n\nHere the function implicitly maps the training vectors into a higher dimensional space.\n\nThe decision function is:\n\nsgn(\n∑\nn\ni=1\ny\ni\nα\ni\nK(\nx\ni\n,x)+ρ)\n[3]\n\n4.2. Neural Network with Dropout\n\nNeural networks’ inputs are modelled as layers of neurons. Its structure is shown in the following figure.\n\nAs shown in Figure 1, the formal neuron uses n inputs\nx\n1\n,\nx\n2\n,⋯,\nx\nn\nx\nto classify the signals coming from dendrites, and are then synoptically weighted correspondingly with\nw\n1\n,\nw\n2\n,⋯,\nw\nn\nw\nthat measure their permeabilities. Then, the excitation level of the neuron is calculated as the weighted sum of input values:\n\nξ=\n∑\ni=1\nn\nw\ni\nx\ni\n\nf in Figure 2 represents activation function.\n\nWhen the value of excitation level x reaches the threshold h, the output y (state) of the neuron is induced. This simulates the electric impulse generated by axon [8] .\n\nDropout is a technique that further improves neural network’s accuracy. In Figure 3, let L be the number of hidden layers,\nl∈{1,⋯,L}\nl\nthe hidden layers of the neural network,\nz(l)\nand\ny(l)\nthe vectors of inputs and outputs of layer\nl\nl\n, respectively.\nW(l)\nand\nb(l)\nb\nare the weights and biases at layer\nl\nl\n. For\nl∈{0,⋯,L−1}\nl\nand any hidden unit i, the network then can be described as:\n\nz\n(l+1)\n=\nw\n(l+1)\ny\nl\n+\nb\n(l+1)\n,iii\n\ny\n(l+1)\n=f(\nz\n(l+1)\n)\n,ii\n\nFigure 2. Neural network model.\n\nFigure 3. Artificial neural network.\n\nwhere f is any activation function.\n\nWith dropout, the feed-forward operation becomes:\n\nr(l)-Bernoulli(p), j\n\ny\n(l)\n=\nr\n(l)\ny\n(l)\n,\n\nz\n(l+1)\n=\nw\n(l+1)\ny\nl\n+\nb\n(l+1)\n,iii [4] .\n\n4.3. Autoencoder\n\nConsider an n/p/n autoencoder.\n\nIn Figure 4, let F and G denote sets, n and p be positive integers where 0 < p < n, and B be a class of functions from Fn to Gp.\n\nDefine\nX={\nx\n1\n,⋯,\nx\nm\n}\nas a set of training vectors in Fn. When there are external targets, let\nY={\ny\n1\n,⋯,\ny\nm\n}\ndenote the corresponding set of target vectors in Fn. And ∆ is a distortion function (e.g. Lp norm, Hamming distance) defined over Fn.\n\nFor any A Î A and B Î B, the input vector x Î Fn becomes output vector A ◦ B(x) Î Fn through the autoencoder. The goal is to find A Î A and B Î B that minimize the overall distortion function:\n\nminE(A,B)=minE(\nx\nt\n)=minΔA∘B(\nx\nt\n),\nx\nt\n[10] .\n\n4.4. Decision Tree\n\nGiven training vectors\nx\ni\n∈\nR\nn\n,\ni=1,⋯,l\ni\nand a label vector\ny∈\nR\nl\n, a decision tree groups the sample according to the same labels.\n\nLet Q represents the data at node m. The tree partitions the data\nθ=(j,\nt\nm\n)\n\nFigure 4.

Experimental Result\n\nThe data we used shown in Table 1, called Qualitative Bankruptcy database, is created by Martin. A, Uthayakumar. j, and Nadarajan. m in February 2014 [10] . The attributes include industrial risk, management risk, financial flexibility, credibility, competitiveness, and operating risk.\n\n5.1. Parallel Comparison\n\n5.1.1.

Conclusions\n\nSupport vector machine, neural network with dropout, and autoencoder are three relatively new models applied in bankruptcy prediction problems. Their accuracies outperform those of the three older models (robust logistic regression, inductive learning algorithms, genetic algorithms). The improved aspects include the control for overfitting, the improved probability of finding the global maxima, and the ability to handle large feature spaces. This paper compared and concluded the progress of machine leaning models regarding bankruptcy prediction, and checked to see the performance of relatively new models in the context of bankruptcy prediction that have rarely been applied in that field.\n\nHowever, the three models also have drawbacks.

This is the flow chart I walk through every time before I kick off a data science project.\n\nQuestion 1: Are you trying to predict something?\n\nIf the answer is yes, then you’re going to want to use a supervised learning technique for your analysis.\n\nIf the answer is no, then you’re going to want to use an unsupervised learning technique for your analysis.\n\nQuestion 2a: Are you predicting something continuous or categorical?\n\nIf you go down the supervised learning route, the next question you need to answer is whether you’re predicting something continuous (house prices, temperature, etc.) or categorical (sale or not, spam or not, etc.).\n\nIf you want to predict something continuous, you’ll need to use a regression technique:\n\nIf you want to predict something categorical, you’ll need to use a classification technique:\n\nQuestion 2b: Are you trying to group data points or reduce features?\n\nIf you aren’t trying to predict something and you go down the unsupervised learning route, the next question you need to answer is whether you want to group your data or reduce the number of features (columns).\n\nIf you want to group your data (aka segment or cluster your data), then you’ll need to use a clustering technique:\n\nIf you want to reduce the number of features, then you’ll need to use a dimensionality reduction technique. Imagine you have 10 columns of data and you want to turn it into 2 columns of data that are able to capture the behavior of the 10 columns — that is where dimensionality reduction comes in.\n\nQuestion 3: Are there algorithms that don’t fall within these four buckets?\n\nYes, but from my experience, I find that the majority of data science problems do fall into these buckets.\n\nHere’s an example of a situation that is outside of this flow chart:\n\nSometimes data scientists are tasked with answering questions such as:\n\nThese questions don’t require machine learning at all (no predictions, no grouping data points, no reducing dimensions), and instead can be answered by slicing and dicing the data using techniques such as filtering, sorting and grouping. This is more formally known as Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA).\n\nHere’s an example of a situation that falls under multiple buckets in this flow chart:\n\nNatural Language Processing is a great example of a field that can incorporate a variety of machine learning techniques.\n\nWhile there are text preprocessing techniques you need to do before applying these algorithms (tokenization, etc.), once your text is transformed into a format that can be input into a model, you can use the same machine learning flow chart.\n\nFinal Thoughts\n\nI truly believe that this flow chart is the best way to kick off a data science project.

    "content3": "\nFinancial Ratios to Spot Companies Headed for Bankruptcy\n\nWhile investors evaluate equities using several different analytical perspectives, including profitability ratios, income ratios, and liquidity ratios, they should be careful to include financial ratios that can specifically be used to provide early warning signals of possible impending bankruptcy. There are key ratios that can provide such warnings well in advance, giving investors plenty of time to dispose of their equity interest before the financial roof falls in.\n\nKEY TAKEAWAYS\n\nCurrent Ratio\n\nThe current ratio, which simply divides current assets by current liabilities, is one of the primary liquidity ratios used for evaluating a company's financial soundness. It evaluates a company's capability of handling all its short-term debt obligations, by measuring the adequacy of the company's current resources to cover all of its debt obligations for the next 12 months.\n1\n\nA higher current ratio indicates that the company has more liquidity. Generally, a current ratio of 2 or higher is considered healthy. A ratio of less than 1 is a definite warning sign.\n\nOperating Cash Flow to Sales\n\nCash and cash flow are key to the success and survival of any business. The operating cash flow to sales ratio—operating cash flow divided by sales revenues—indicates a company's ability to generate cash from its sales. The ideal relationship between operating cash flow and sales is one of parallel increases.\n2\n\nIf cash flows do not increase in line with sales increases, this is cause for concern, and it may be an indication of inefficient management of costs or accounts receivables. As with the current ratio, generally speaking, the higher this ratio is, the better. Analysts prefer to see improving, or at least consistent, numbers over time.\n\nDebt/Equity Ratio\n\nThe debt/equity (D/E) ratio, a leverage ratio, is one of the most frequently used ratios for evaluating a company's financial health. It provides a primary measure of a company's ability to meet financing obligations and of the structure of a company's financing, whether it comes more from equity investors or more from debt financing. If this ratio is high or increasing, it indicates the company is overly dependent on financing from creditors as opposed to capital provided by equity investors.\n\nIMPORTANT\n\nBoth equity financing and debt financing can be beneficial for a company; both have their pros and cons. Debt financing is not a bad option as long as it is managed well.\n\nThe ratio is also important because it is one of the factors considered by lenders. If lenders believe the ratio is getting uncomfortably high, they may be unwilling to extend further credit to the company. An optimal D/E ratio is about 1, where equity roughly equals liabilities. Although the D/E ratio varies between industries, the general rule is that a ratio higher than 2 is considered unhealthy.\n\nCash Flow to Debt Ratio\n\nCash flow is essential to any business. No business can operate without the necessary cash to pay bills; make payments on loans, rentals, or mortgages; meet payroll; and pay necessary taxes. The cash flow to debt ratio, calculated as cash flow from operations divided by total debt, is sometimes considered the single best predictor of financial business failure.\n\nThis coverage ratio indicates the theoretical period that it would take a company to retire all of its outstanding debt if 100% of its cash flow was dedicated to debt payment. A higher ratio indicates a company is more soundly capable of covering its debt.\n\nSome analysts use free cash flow instead of cash flow from operations in the calculation because free cash flow factors in capital expenditures. A ratio higher than 1 is generally considered healthy, but any value below 1 is commonly interpreted as signaling impending bankruptcy within a few years unless the company takes steps to substantially improve its financial condition.\n\nAnother metric often used to predict potential bankruptcy is the Z-score, which is a combination of several financial ratios used to produce a single composite score.\n\nWhat Financial Ratios Determine Bankruptcy?\n\nThere are a handful of financial ratios that can help determine if a company is heading toward bankruptcy. These include the gross profit margin, the cash flow to debt ratio, the debt to equity ratio, and the current ratio.\n\nWhat Financial Ratios Do Creditors Look At?\n\nThe financial ratios that creditors look at are the cash flow to debt ratio, the quick ratio, and the debt to service coverage ratio.\n\nWhat Debt/Equity Ratio Is Considered Bankruptcy Risk?\n\nA debt/equity ratio of 2 or higher is considered to be indicative of a company that may end up bankrupt. The higher the number, the more the company has in liabilities than assets, which means it is relying on its debt over its equity, which is risky.\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nFinancial ratios help understand a company's financial statements and put the numbers into context. It's important to use financial ratios to gain an understanding of any company you are thinking of investing in or are already invested in and wondering if you should continue to do so. These ratios will provide insight that will guide you in your investing decisions.\n\nRelated Articles\n"
