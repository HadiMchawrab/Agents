As cybercriminals adopt more sophisticated methods, conventional security systems need help to keep pace. The sheer volume of data generated by modern networks further complicates the detection of threats, leaving many organizations vulnerable to attacks.\nAI offers a solution to these challenges by:\n\nHow is AI Used in Cybersecurity?\nAI has numerous applications in cybersecurity, from detecting threats to automating responses. Below are three of the most common ways AI is leveraged:\n\nAI in Cybersecurity: Where CISOs are Investing and Cutting\nLearn how GenAI helps City of Hope’s security team prioritize exposures, remediate vulnerabilities, and align across departments for better risk management.\n\nThreat Detection\nAI excels at identifying threats that would otherwise go unnoticed. Traditional security tools may overlook anomalies or struggle to recognize zero-day threats. However, AI-powered systems use pattern recognition and anomaly detection to spot unusual activity that could indicate an attack. Additionally, AI-powered systems can continuously scan networks and systems for vulnerabilities, automatically flagging potential weak points.\n\nThreat Management\nOnce a threat is detected, AI is key in automating the management process. AI can prioritize vulnerabilities based on their potential impact, enabling organizations to address critical issues first and streamline patch management. This involves prioritizing threats based on risk levels and determining the most appropriate response. AI can help orchestrate responses in real time, minimizing the damage caused by an attack.\n\nThreat Response\nIn addition to detecting and managing threats, AI can automate many aspects of threat response. This includes taking actions such as blocking malicious traffic, isolating affected systems, and generating incident reports. AI’s ability to adapt and evolve makes it a valuable tool for responding to emerging threats as they unfold.\n\nTop Benefits of AI in Cybersecurity\n\n1. Improved Threat Intelligence\nAI enhances threat intelligence by analyzing large datasets in real time and providing predictive insights. This capability allows cybersecurity teams to anticipate attacks before they occur and take proactive measures to defend against them.\n\n2. Faster Incident Response Times\nSpeed is crucial during a cyberattack, and AI enhances incident response by automating threat detection, analysis, and mitigation. Thus, the time from detection to action is reduced, and potential breach impacts are minimized. AI-powered systems provide improved context for prioritizing security alerts, enable rapid incident response, and identify root causes to mitigate vulnerabilities and prevent future issues.\n\n4. Better Vulnerability Management\nAI’s ability to identify vulnerabilities in networks and systems is another significant advantage. AI-powered vulnerability scanners can prioritize risks based on reachability, exploitability, and business criticality, helping organizations address the most pressing issues first. This reduces false positives and ensures that security teams are working efficiently.\n\n5. More Accurate Breach Risk Predictions\nAccounting for IT asset inventory, threat exposure, and security controls effectiveness, AI-based systems can predict how and where you are most likely to be breached so that you can plan for resource and tool allocation toward areas of weakness. Prescriptive insights derived from AI analysis can help you configure and enhance controls and processes to improve your organization’s cyber resilience most effectively.\n\n6. Automated Recommendations\nAnother key to harnessing AI to augment human infosec teams is the explainability of recommendations and analysis. This is important in getting buy-in from stakeholders across the organization, understanding the impact of various infosec programs, and reporting relevant information to all stakeholders, including end users, security operations, CISO, auditors, CIO, CEO and board of directors.\n\nKey AI Technologies in Cybersecurity\n\nMachine Learning (ML)\nMachine learning (ML) is a form of AI that enables systems to learn from data and improve without explicit programming. In cybersecurity, a typical application of ML is User and Entity Behavior Analytics (UEBA), which analyzes patterns and behaviors to detect threats.\nFor example, UEBA can flag unusual login activity by identifying anomalies in user behavior, such as abnormal login times or locations, which may signal a security breach and enable faster responses. ML excels in tasks like identifying network traffic anomalies and helping prevent attacks by recognizing irregular behavior before they escalate.\n\nDeep Learning\nDeep learning, a subset of ML, uses neural networks to analyze complex data and is highly effective in detecting advanced cybersecurity threats, such as evolving malware strains. In cybersecurity, Deep Learning is used to detect polymorphic malware, which constantly changes its code to evade traditional detection methods.\nDeep learning models can analyze vast amounts of data and recognize underlying patterns in malware behavior, even when the code differs. For example, deep learning can identify anomalies in how files interact with a system, flagging malicious intent even if the malware has never been encountered before.\nThis ability to learn from subtle behavioral patterns significantly improves detection and response times to previously unseen threats, making deep learning essential in staying ahead of sophisticated cyberattacks.\n\nNeural Networks\nNeural networks are AI models inspired by the human brain’s structure. In them, nodes process data through weighted inputs. Each node evaluates its input, adjusting weights to improve accuracy. The final result is based on the sum of these evaluations. In cybersecurity, neural networks help analyze vast amounts of data, such as firewall logs, to identify patterns and predict potential threats, making them a powerful tool for threat detection.\n\nLarge Language Models (LLMs)\nLarge Language Models (LLMs), such as GPT-4, represent another significant AI technology in cybersecurity. LLMs specialize in processing and understanding human language, making them highly useful for automating threat analysis and improving security responses. These models can sift through vast amounts of text data—such as threat reports, logs, and documentation—to identify potential risks and patterns that could signal an attack.\nLLMs also help with tasks like phishing detection, generating human-readable threat reports, and automating responses to security incidents. By understanding the context of language, they can enhance cybersecurity tools, enabling faster and more accurate decision-making.\n\nLatest Developments in AI for Cybersecurity\n\n1. AI-Powered Remediation\nAs AI continues to evolve, one of the most promising innovations is AI-powered remediation, which automates the response to security incidents in real-time. Traditional incident response processes often involve manual investigation, decision-making, and intervention, resulting in delays that give attackers more time to exploit vulnerabilities. AI-powered remediation, on the other hand, can immediately act on detected threats by isolating affected systems, blocking malicious traffic, or even rolling back compromised systems to a secure state.\n\n2.

While technological advancements have made it easy for organizations to upgrade their security measures, malicious hackers are now using sophisticated tools. This means that in addition to implementing strict cybersecurity policies, you also have to take proactive measures to reduce your cybersecurity risks.\nDownload our guide on scaling third-party risk management despite the odds\nAs an organization, you can't afford to leave your data security up to chance. The business impact could be astronomical, it could result in lost revenue, operational disruption, and stolen customer data. Data breaches also cause reputational damage that, in some cases, could take you out of business. So, with everything that's at risk, how can you reduce cybersecurity risk for your organization? Here are 10 practical strategies that you should implement.\n\nA Complete Guide to Data Breaches\nDownload this eBook to learn how to avoid a costly data breach with a comprehensive prevention strategy.\n\n1. Encrypt Your Data and Create Backups\nMake sure all your sensitive data is encrypted. Saving your data in normal-text format only makes it easy for hackers to access. Data encryption, on the other hand, limits data access to parties that have the encryption key. It also ensures that even when unauthorized parties gain access to the data, they can't read it. Some data encryption software even lets you know when other people try to alter or tamper with the information.\nYou should also conduct regular backups for your important information. Sometimes cybersecurity breaches can result in data loss. When this happens, and you don't have a reliable and secure backup, it could result in operational disruptions that could cause your organization a lot of lost revenue. One of the most effective data backup strategies is the 3-2-1 rule. Based on this strategy, you should have at least 3 copies of your data stored. 2 of them should be stored on different media, and one should be in an offsite location.\n\n2. Conduct Regular Employee Training\nOne of the common ways malicious hackers gain access to your database is through phishing emails sent to your employees. In fact, statistics show that over 3.4 billion phishing emails are sent globally. These emails contain malicious malware in the form of links that give hackers access to user data, including login credentials.\nPhishing emails are often hard to detect as they seem legitimate. For instance, a hacker may send an email impersonating leaders in the organization asking for personal details. Without proper training, the employee may end up divulging this information. This is why it's vital that you conduct cybersecurity awareness training. Let your employees know of the main forms of cybersecurity attacks and the best ways to prevent them.\nYou should also emphasize the importance of checking email addresses before replying to them and checking links before clicking on them. Finally, don't forget to highlight the organizational policy when it comes to sharing sensitive information, even on social media.\n\nA Complete Guide to Data Breaches\nDownload this eBook to learn how to avoid a costly data breach with a comprehensive prevention strategy.\n\n3. Keep Your Systems and Software Updated\nSoftware and system updates highly impact your cyber security and digital safety. This is because they not only add new features but also fix bugs and help patch security flaws and vulnerabilities that can be exploited.\nMalicious hackers write code that they use to exploit the vulnerabilities. Most of the time, this code is packaged in the form of malware which can affect your entire system. So, make sure you use a patch management system to automatically manage all updates and uphold information security.\n\n4. Use Strong Passwords\nHere's an interesting fact; over 80% of organizational data breaches result from weak passwords. Hackers don't need much to gain access to your systems. They only require a small gap, and they'll exploit it fully.\nPassword cracking technology has greatly advanced, and simple passwords don't cut it anymore. Instead, you need to use complex passwords and deploy multi-factor authentication strategies to discourage cybercrime in your organization. You should also discourage password sharing among employees so that even if one desktop is hacked, the rest remain secure.\nSome of the security risk mitigation strategies you should implement when it comes to passwords include;\nDon't forget to keep your password safely stored in an encrypted format.\nWith many employees now working from home, bring-your-own-device (BYOD) is becoming increasingly common. Advise iOS users to enable the Security Recommendations feature to monitor the strength of their saved passwords.\n\n5. Assess and Monitor Your Vendors\nChances are that your cyber security is highly dependent on third-party vendors, which is why you can’t afford to ignore vendor risk management. This will help you mitigate third-party risk instead of solely relying on incident response.\nYour main focus should be on:\nDon't leave your cybersecurity to chance, so make sure you manage your third-party exposure as soon as possible.\n\n6. Reduce Your Attack Surface\nYour attack surfaces are the vulnerabilities or entry points that malicious hackers can use to access sensitive data. They could be anything like IoT, software, web application systems, and even employees that are often susceptible to social engineering attacks such as whaling and phishing.\nThere are 3 main types of attack surfaces:\nMake sure you conduct an attack surface analysis to determine your threat landscape, identify all your security gaps and reduce the attack vectors.\n\n7. Pay Close Attention to Physical Security\nMost organizational cyber risk management policies focus on the digital aspect of cyber risks and entirely neglect their physical premises. Conduct a security assessment and determine whether your critical infrastructure is safe from security breaches. You should also analyze your data protection policy and decide whether or not it has data disposal strategies.\nThink of a scenario where your online systems are safe from cybercriminals, but you experience a breach because someone broke into your offices and rummaged through your file cabinets. That would be tragic! There are even other instances where janitors go through the garbage and obtain customer and employee personal information.\nIf you have any restricted areas, make sure they are protected using high-value systems. You should also use 2-factor authentication such as keycards and biometrics. This way, even if the keycard is lost or stolen, no one will be able to access the area.\n\n8. Put a Killswitch in Place\nHaving a killswitch protects you from large-scale attacks. It is a form of reactive cybersecurity protection strategy where your information technology department shuts down all systems as soon as they detect anything suspicious until they resolve the issues.\nMost of the time, cybercriminals don't cover their tracks, especially when they don't expect to be caught. So, have your IT security teams analyze all server logs frequently and conduct cybersecurity framework audits to make sure their integrity is intact. You should also invest in network forensic analysis tools that analyze information flow through your network.\nMost malicious firewall and ransomware attacks are a result of human error. Some of them are even caused by your employees. In fact, statistics show that around 94% of organizations have suffered cyber security threats due to insider breaches. Make sure you scan all new hires to ascertain that they aren't a cyber risk to your organization. You should also put measures to discourage employee negligence, which is a major contributor to cyber risks.\n\n9. Install Firewalls\nCyber security threats are becoming more sophisticated, and everyday hackers come up with new ways of accessing data. So, you should defend your networks from cyber attacks by installing firewalls. A reliable system will effectively protect you from brute attacks or prevent security incidents from causing irreversible damage.\nIn addition to this, firewalls monitor your network traffic to identify any suspicious activity that could compromise your data integrity. They also prevent complex spyware from gaining access to your systems and promote data privacy.\nBe very careful when choosing the right firewall for your organization. Go for a system that gives you full security control and visibility of your application and networks. It should also have protection and prevention capabilities as well as a streamlined security infrastructure.\n\n10. Create A Secure Cybersecurity Policy\nYour organization's cybersecurity is highly influenced by the policies that you have in place. Do you have guidelines for data breach prevention and detection? How often do your IT teams conduct risk assessments or penetration testing? It all starts with your guidelines!\nGo through your existing policies and identify any loopholes they may have. Some of the guidelines you should have in place include;\nMake sure your plan also has a clause that highlights the consequences of data mishandling as well as the legal steps that will be taken on employees that are the cause of a breach. This will discourage insider attacks.\n\nTips to Develop Your Cyber Risk Management Strategy\nIn addition to these 10 ways to reduce your cybersecurity risk, consider these tips when developing your cyber risk management strategy.\n\nProtect Your Organization From Cybersecurity Risks Today\nDuring the first half of 2021 alone, over 118 million people were impacted by data breaches. In fact, statistics of this year’s data breaches were significantly higher than those of the past year. The best way to ensure that your organization is safe is by taking proactive measures.
