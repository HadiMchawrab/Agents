By leveraging Generative AI (GenAI) to solve these complex decision-making tasks, organizations can become more efficient and productive in their operations.\n\nThis article outlines best practices for using GenAI in constrained optimization, using a real-world example: an AI-powered college course scheduling solution. These lessons have been gathered by implementing solutions with Microsoft partners and customers.\n\nUnderstanding Constrained Optimization in AI\n\nConstrained optimization involves finding the best solution to a problem while satisfying a set of predefined constraints. These constraints could be based on rules, resources, or preferences. Traditional optimization techniques, such as linear programming, evolutionary algorithms, and constraint satisfaction solvers, have been historically used for these tasks. In today's AI landscape, we find that GenAI can significantly accelerate solution development in this problem domain.\n\nHowever, successfully integrating GenAI into constrained optimization requires careful consideration of trade-offs, architecture choices, and mitigation of potential failures like hallucination.\n\nReal-World Example: AI-Powered Course Scheduling\n\nLet’s consider a specific scenario – AI-assisted scheduling for college courses – to illustrate concepts, implementation, and best practices for solving a constrained optimization problem with Azure OpenAI o-series reasoning models.\n\nFor this use case, GenAI can help recommend courses based on major, course prerequisites, student data, and student preferences. The following architecture illustrates implementing a course scheduling system with a multi-agent solution, leveraging the Reflection pattern outlined here: Microsoft AutoGen Reflection.\n\nThe following architecture diagram illustrates an example implementation of this solution, where Azure SQL Database is leveraged to store student information and course data.\n\nThe steps for solving this course scheduling problem are as follows:\n\nThe student provides details such as their major, number of courses they want to take, and preferences (e.g., “I am a computer science major, and I'd like to take 3 major courses and 1 elective next semester. I prefer morning and in-person courses”).\n\nThe student’s request gets routed to the first agent — the scheduling agent — which queries a datastore for available courses. With the appropriate grounding data, the agent sends the student query and courses to Azure OpenAI to generate a course schedule.\n\nTo ensure accuracy and that there are no course conflicts while adhering to student preferences, the reviewer agent considers the proposed schedule and sends feedback to the scheduling agent. The reviewer may either approve or request a revision to the schedule while providing feedback to the scheduler.\n\nBest Practices for Using GenAI in Constrained Optimization\n\nAdditional Examples of Constrained Optimization\n\nConclusion\n\nGenAI can be applied in constrained optimization across diverse industries. However, to maximize its effectiveness, AI practitioners must:\n\nBy following these best practices, businesses can leverage AI to solve complex optimization challenges efficiently and reliably.\n\nBest Practices for Requesting Quota Increase for Azure OpenAI Models\n\nBest Practices for Leveraging Azure OpenAI in Code Conversion Scenarios\n\nBest Practices for Structured Extraction from Documents Using Azure OpenAI\n"
