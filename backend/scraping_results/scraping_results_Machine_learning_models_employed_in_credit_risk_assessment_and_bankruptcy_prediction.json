This project leverages machine learning models to assess corporate financial health, reducing risk exposure and enhancing portfolio decision-making. Using the Polish Companies Bankruptcy Dataset (2000‚Äì2013), this model evaluates key financial indicators to classify firms as financially stable or at risk of bankruptcy. This project achieved 96.28% accuracy using Calibrated XGBoost, demonstrating a scalable approach to modern credit risk evaluation and financial health assessment.\n\nWhy It Matters\n\nKey Features\n\nMachine Learning Models: This project evaluates multiple models to balance accuracy, precision, and recall for bankruptcy prediction:\n\nBaseline Model: Logistic Regression:\n\nAdvanced Model: Random Forest:\n\nAdvanced Model: XGBoost Model:\n\nAdvanced Model: Calibrated XGBoost (Best Model):\n\nWhy Calibrated XGBoost?\nBy applying Isotonic Regression, the calibrated XGBoost model improves probability estimates, making it more effective for financial decision-making where precision and recall must be balanced.\n\nFeature Importance: What Drives Bankruptcy Risk?\n\nThis model identifies the most influential financial ratios in predicting bankruptcy using XGBoost‚Äôs gain-based ranking. What does \"gain\" mean?\n\nTop 10 Features Influencing Bankruptcy Predictions\n\n1Ô∏è‚É£ Return on Assets = Net Profit / Total Assets\n2Ô∏è‚É£ Liabilities Ratio = Total Liabilities / Total Assets\n3Ô∏è‚É£ Cash Ratio\n4Ô∏è‚É£ Net Working Capital Ratio = Working Capital / Total Assets\n5Ô∏è‚É£ Basic Earning Power = EBIT / Total Assets\n6Ô∏è‚É£ Debt Repayment Ratio\n7Ô∏è‚É£ Asset Turnover Ratio = Sales / Total Assets\n8Ô∏è‚É£ Equity Ratio = Equity / Total Assets\n9Ô∏è‚É£ Short-Term Profitability Ratio = Gross Profit / Short-Term Liabilities\nüîü Retained Earnings Ratio = Retained Earnings / Total Assets\n\nData Source\n\nDataset: Polish Companies Bankruptcy Dataset (UCI Repository) https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/365/polish+companies+bankruptcy+data. Please go to the UCI Repository link and download the zip file before running the code\n\nScope: 2000‚Äì2013 financial data covering 5 years of company records\n\nVariables: Profitability, liquidity, leverage, and efficiency ratios\n\nBusiness Use Case & Deployment\n\nThis model has broad applications across banking, investment, and corporate finance, offering predictive insights to mitigate financial risk.\n\nLending & Credit Risk Management\n\nInvestment & Portfolio Risk Analysis\n\nCorporate Finance & Risk Monitoring\n\nModel Deployment & Integration\n\nTechnology Stack\n\nNext Steps & Future Roadmap\n\nWhile this model demonstrates strong predictive performance, particularly with Calibrated XGBoost, there are opportunities to refine its accuracy and applicability further. Enhancing recall for the minority class, incorporating real-time financial data, and improving model interpretability will be key areas of focus moving forward.\n\nFurther Optimization of Calibrated XGBoost:\n\nFeature Engineering & Refinement:\n\nBusiness Application & Deployment:\n\nModel Interpretability:\n\nAlternative Modeling Techniques:\n\nExpanding Dataset Scope:\n\nDeployment & Integration:\n\nFeel free to reach out or contribute to this project for further improvements!\n\nAbout\n\nMachine Learning Model to Predict Bankruptcy\n\nResources\n\nStars\n\nWatchers\n\nForks\n\nReleases\n\nPackages\n\nLanguages\n\nFooter\n\nFooter navigation\n",
