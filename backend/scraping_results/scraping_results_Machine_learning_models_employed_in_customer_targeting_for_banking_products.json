Now, machine learning has changed this process. Machine learning algorithms can analyze large amounts of data. In this article, we will explore how machine learning improves customer segmentation.\n\nIntroduction to Customer Segmentation\n\nCustomer segmentation divides customers into different groups. These groups are based on similar traits or behaviors. The main goal is to understand each group better. This helps businesses create marketing strategies and products that fit each group’s specific needs.\n\nThe customers can be divided into groups based on several criteria:\n\nCustomer segmentation offers several advantages for businesses:\n\nMachine learning Algorithms for Customer Segmentation\n\nMachine learning uses several algorithms to categorize customers based on their features. Some commonly used algorithms include:\n\nWe will use K-means algorithm to segment customers into various groups.\n\nImplementing K-means Clustering Algorithm\n\nK-means clustering is an unsupervised algorithm. It operates without any predefined labels or training examples. This algorithm is used to group similar data points in a dataset. The goal is to divide the data into clusters. Each cluster contains similar data points. Let’s see how this algorithm works.\n\nRepeat steps 2 and 3 until convergence.\n\nIn the following sections, we are going to implement K-means clustering algorithm to group customers into clusters according to different features.\n\nData Preparation\n\nLet’s explore the customer dataset. Our dataset has around 5,00,000 data points.\n\nCustomer dataset\n\nThe missing values and duplicates are removed and three features (‘Quantity’, ‘UnitPrice’, ‘CustomerID’) are selected for clustering.\n\nPre-processed dataset\n\nHyperparameter Tuning\n\nOne challenge in K-means clustering is to find out the optimal number of clusters. The elbow method help us in doing so. It plots the sum of squared distances from each point to its assigned cluster centroid (inertia) against K. T Look for the point where the inertia no longer decreases significantly with increasing K. This point is called the elbow of the clustering model. It suggests a suitable K value.\n\nWe can generate an inertia vs number of clusters plot using the above code.\n\nElbow method\n\nAt K=1, inertia is at the highest. From K=1 to K=5, the inertia decreases steeply. Between K=5 to K=7, the curve decreases gradually. Finally, at K=7, it becomes stable, so the optimal value of K is 7.\n\nVisualizing Segmentation Results\n\nLet’s implement K-means clustering algorithm and visualize the results.\n\nScatter plot\n\nThe 3D scatter plot visualizes the clusters based on ‘Quantity’, ‘UnitPrice’, and ‘CustomerID’. Each cluster is differentiated by color and labeled accordingly.\n\nConclusion\n\nWe have discussed customer segmentation using machine learning and its benefits. Furthermore, we showed how to implement the K-means algorithm to segment customers into different groups. First, we found a suitable number of clusters using the elbow method. Then, we implemented the K-means algorithm and visualized the results using a scatter plot. Through these steps, companies can segment customers into groups efficiently.\n\nMore On This Topic\n\nAbout Jayita Gulati\n\n2 Responses to Using Machine Learning in Customer Segmentation\n\nnice article!

Segmentation, the technique of splitting customers into separate groups depending on their attributes or behavior, makes this possible.\n\nOther marketing responsibilities, such as up-selling methods, product recommendations, and pricing can benefit from customer segmentation.\n\nCustomer segmentation used to be a difficult and time-consuming operation that required hours of human labor combing through several tables and querying the data in the hopes of discovering ways to group customers together.\n\nMachine learning, or artificial intelligence algorithms that detect statistical regularities in data, has made it considerably easier in recent years. Customer data can be processed using machine learning models, which may then be used to find repeating trends across a variety of variables.\n\nMachine learning algorithms may often assist marketing analysts in identifying client subgroups that would be difficult to identify using intuition and manual data analysis.\n\nCustomer segmentation is a fantastic example of how artificial intelligence and human intuition may work together to create something better.\n\nThe k-means algorithm\n\nMachine learning algorithms come in a variety of flavors, each tailored to a particular task. K-means clustering is one of the techniques that are useful for customer segmentation.\n\nUnsupervised algorithms lack a labeled data against which to evaluate their performance.\n\nThe difference between the consumers’ age, income, and spending scores are used to calculate the similarity between clusters in this scenario.\n\nYou indicate the number of clusters you want to divide your data into while training a k-means model. The model begins with centroids that are randomly placed variables that determine the center of each cluster.\n\nThe model examines the training data and assigns them to the cluster with the closest centroid. After all of the training, examples have been categorized, the centroids’ parameters are re-adjusted to put them in the middle of their clusters.\n\nAdditionally to k-means clustering, the elbow approach is an effective data segmentation technique for determining the ideal number of machine learning segmentation clusters.\n\nBecause ML systems are more fragile than you think. All based on our open-source core.\n\nImportance of segmentation\n\nBy evaluating their distance from each of the cluster centroids, your machine learning model can decide which segment new clients belong to once it has been trained. There are numerous applications for this.\n\nMachine learning algorithms for customer segmentation will assist you in fine-tuning your product marketing strategies. For example, you may begin an ad campaign with a random sample of clients from various segments. After a period, you may look at which groups are more active and tailor your strategy to only show advertising to those who belong to those parts.\n\nYou could also run many versions of your campaign and use machine learning to segment your clients depending on their answers to the various efforts. You’ll have a lot more tools to test and fine-tune your ad campaigns in general.\n\nHowever, it isn’t a magic wand that will change your data into logical client categories in an instant. You must first choose the target audience for your marketing efforts and the elements that will be important to them. If your advertisements will be focused on specific locations, for example, geographic location will be irrelevant, and you’ll be better off filtering your data for that region.\n\nSimilarly, if you’re pushing a men’s health product, you should filter your customer data to solely include guys and avoid using gender as one of your machine learning model’s attributes.\n\nIn other circumstances, you’ll want to offer additional information, such as things they’ve already purchased. In this situation, you’ll need to make a customer-product matrix, which is a table with customers as rows and things as columns, as well as the number of things purchased at each customer and item’s intersection.\n\nIf there are too many products, consider establishing an embedding, in which the products are represented as values in a multidimensional vector space.\n\nMachine learning is a powerful tool for marketing and customer segmentation in general. It will almost certainly never be able to replace human intuition and decision-making, but it can help boost human efforts to previously unattainable levels.\n\nRelated Terms\n\n© 2025 Deepchecks AI.
