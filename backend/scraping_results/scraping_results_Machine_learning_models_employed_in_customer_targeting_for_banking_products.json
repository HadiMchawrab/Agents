To follow it step by step, you can use thefree trial.\n\n1. Application type\nThe variable to be predicted is binary (buy or not buy). Thus, this is aclassificationproject.\nThe goal here is to model the probability of buying as a function of the customer features.\n\n2. Data set\nIn general, adata setcontains the following concepts:\nThe data filebank_marketing.csvcontains the information used to create the model. It consists of 1522 rows and 19 columns. Each row represents a different customer, while each column represents a distinct feature for each customer.\nThevariablesare:\nThere are 1522instancesin the data set. 60% are used for training, 20% for selection, and 20% for testing.\nWe can calculate the datadistributionto see the percentage of instances for each class.\nAs expected, the number of calls without conversion is much greater than the number of calls with conversion.\nWe can also calculate theinputs-targets correlationsbetween the conversion rate and all the customer features to see which variables might influence the buying process.\n\n3. Neural network\nThe second step is to configure theneural networkparameters. For classification problems, it is composed of:\nThe following figure is a graphical representation of the neural network used for this problem.\n\n4. Training strategy\nThe fourth step is to configure thetraining strategy, which is composed of two concepts:\nTheloss indexchosen is theweighted squared errorwithL2 regularization.\nTheoptimization algorithmis applied to the neural network to get the minimum loss.\nThe chosen algorithm here is thequasi-Newton method. We leave the default training parameters, stopping criteria, and training history settings.\nThe following chart shows how the training and selection errors decrease with the epochs during the training process. The final values aretraining error = 0.821 WSEandselection error = 0.889 WSE, respectively.\n\n5. Model selection\nThe objective ofmodel selectionis to find a network architecture with the best generalization properties, that is, that which minimizes the error on theselected instancesof the data set.\nMore specifically, we want to find a neural network with a selection error of less than0.889 WSE, which is the value that we have achieved so far.\nOrder selectionalgorithms train several network architectures with a different number of neurons and select that with the smallest selection error.\nTheincremental ordermethod starts with a small number of neurons and increases the complexity at each iteration. The following chart shows the training error (blue) and the selection error (orange) as a function of the number of neurons.\n\n6. Testing analysis\nThe objective of thetesting analysisis to evaluate the generalization performance of the neural network. The standard way to do this is to compare the neural network outputs against data that it has never seen before, thetesting instances.\nA commonly used method to test a neural network is theROC curve.\nOne of the parameters obtained from this chart is the area under the curve (AUC). The closer to 1 is the area under the curve, the better is the classifier. In this case, the area under the curve takes a high value:AUC = 0.80.\nThebinary classification testsprovide us with useful information for testing the performance of a binary classification problem:\nThe classification accuracy takes a high value, which means that the prediction is suitable for many cases.\nThe second is another visual aid that shows the advantage of using a predictive model against randomness. The next picture depicts thecumulative gainfor the current example.\nAs we can see, this chart shows that by calling only half of the clients, we can achieve more than 80% of the positive responses.\nTheconversion ratesfor this problem are depicted in the following chart.\n\n7. Model deployment\nIn themodel deploymentphase, the neural network can be used for different techniques.\nWe can predict which clients have more probability of buying the product by calculating theneural network outputs. We need to know the input variables for each new client.\nThemathematical expressionrepresented by the neural network is written below. It takes all the features of a customer to produce the output prediction. The information is propagated in a feed-forward fashion for classification problems through the scaling, perceptron, and probabilistic layers. This expression can be exported anywhere.\n\nReferences:\n\nRelated posts\n\nExperience the Power of Neural Designer\nTake your business to new heights with Neural Designer.The ultimate solution for harnessing the power of artificial intelligence and machine learning.\n\nExplanable AI Platform.\n\nFind Us At:\n\n© 2025 - Artificial Intelligence Techniques, Ltd.

Now, machine learning has changed this process. Machine learning algorithms can analyze large amounts of data. In this article, we will explore how machine learning improves customer segmentation.\n\nIntroduction to Customer Segmentation\nCustomer segmentation divides customers into different groups. These groups are based on similar traits or behaviors. The main goal is to understand each group better. This helps businesses create marketing strategies and products that fit each group’s specific needs.\nThe customers can be divided into groups based on several criteria:\nCustomer segmentation offers several advantages for businesses:\n\nMachine learning Algorithms for Customer Segmentation\nMachine learning uses several algorithms to categorize customers based on their features. Some commonly used algorithms include:\nWe will use K-means algorithm to segment customers into various groups.\n\nImplementing K-means Clustering Algorithm\nK-means clustering is an unsupervised algorithm. It operates without any predefined labels or training examples. This algorithm is used to group similar data points in a dataset. The goal is to divide the data into clusters. Each cluster contains similar data points. Let’s see how this algorithm works.\nRepeat steps 2 and 3 until convergence.\nIn the following sections, we are going to implement K-means clustering algorithm to group customers into clusters according to different features.\n\nData Preparation\nLet’s explore the customer dataset. Our dataset has around 5,00,000 data points.\nCustomer dataset\nThe missing values and duplicates are removed and three features (‘Quantity’, ‘UnitPrice’, ‘CustomerID’) are selected for clustering.\nPre-processed dataset\n\nHyperparameter Tuning\nOne challenge in K-means clustering is to find out the optimal number of clusters. The elbow method help us in doing so. It plots the sum of squared distances from each point to its assigned cluster centroid (inertia) against K. T Look for the point where the inertia no longer decreases significantly with increasing K. This point is called the elbow of the clustering model. It suggests a suitable K value.\nWe can generate an inertia vs number of clusters plot using the above code.\nElbow method\nAt K=1, inertia is at the highest. From K=1 to K=5, the inertia decreases steeply. Between K=5 to K=7, the curve decreases gradually. Finally, at K=7, it becomes stable, so the optimal value of K is 7.\n\nVisualizing Segmentation Results\nLet’s implement K-means clustering algorithm and visualize the results.\nScatter plot\nThe 3D scatter plot visualizes the clusters based on ‘Quantity’, ‘UnitPrice’, and ‘CustomerID’. Each cluster is differentiated by color and labeled accordingly.\n\nConclusion\nWe have discussed customer segmentation using machine learning and its benefits. Furthermore, we showed how to implement the K-means algorithm to segment customers into different groups. First, we found a suitable number of clusters using the elbow method. Then, we implemented the K-means algorithm and visualized the results using a scatter plot. Through these steps, companies can segment customers into groups efficiently.\n\nMore On This Topic\n\n2 Responses toUsing Machine Learning in Customer Segmentation\nnice article!
