Some retailers report up to 40% of stock unsold, resulting in significant barriers to forecasting accuracy errors.\n\nThe implementation of AI demand forecasting in retail can address this challenge, answering the recurring questions more swiftly:\n\nIn this article, we’ll share our experience with developing machine learning analytics modules for demand and sales forecasting. Based on MobiDev’s 6+ years in artificial intelligence development and 15+ years in general software development, we elaborate on frequent concerns about what those systems are capable of, and what you’ll need to develop one for your specific case.\n\nSALES FORECASTING VS DEMAND FORECASTING\n\nSales and demand forecasting are closely related terms but use different sets of data. While sales forecasting requires only historical data generated through actual transactions, demand forecasting may also include weather reports, customer surveys, web analytics, social media scraping, etc.\n\nBusinesses-wise, it can make sense to start gradually with the development of a sales forecasting system, if there is not enough qualified demand data. However, for both types of forecasting systems, it’s essential to understand that they are vulnerable to anomalies or unpredictable situations. It means that machine learning models should be upgraded according to current reality.\n\nPRECONDITIONS FOR USING AI FOR DEMAND FORECASTING\n\nIf you perform demand forecasting in some manual form with the help of spreadsheets, you might already have a set of data that you use for calculations. So at this point, it already makes sense to think about automating the whole process with artificial intelligence if you have a number of preconditions:\n\n1. DEMAND DATA AVAILABILITY\n\nEven though sales data is the most available piece of information for working with machine learning forecasting models, demand forecasting requires more than just historical sales. If you already set up some processes and infrastructure to collect data on your internal and external factors, it can be used for machine learning easier than collecting it from scratch.\n\nAdditionally, if you already have historical data for multiple years from the past, it will allow you to start developing an artificial intelligence solution and already bring value. Predicting inventory level implies we need your specific sales, which can’t be sourced elsewhere or bought on a dataset market.\n\n2. PREDICTION FREQUENCY\n\nDifferent business types will require different frequencies of forecasting. Conducting analysis on a monthly or even weekly basis can be a challenging task in terms of manual forecasting.\n\nIn this case, it’s a no-brainer that using machine learning frees up the resources, because it suggests an automated pipeline that gathers data and provides demand forecasts for given periods. One thing to keep in mind is that, the shorter the forecasting period, the less accurate it will be since it’s impossible to generate enough data to cover all the required time changes.\n\n3. MULTIPLE VENUE DEMAND FORECASTING\n\nFor businesses owning multiple selling points that are set across different regions, forecasting demand will require a lot of human resources. Since seasonality, geography, and competition will all be different.\n\nSetting up a system that sources data scattered across multiple databases, and presents analytics through a single dashboard, reduces the cost of demand forecasting in retail itself. In turn, a unified analytical solution presents a 360 view of your venues, inventory and sales activities allowing more flexibility in terms of planning and inventory management.\n\nBased on our experience building demand forecasting modules for our clients, the use of machine learning for demand forecasting is a large competitive advantage. Since your business obtains better visibility and frees the human resources for development activities, rather than focusing on operational things.\n\nFrom a technical standpoint, creating forecasts for multiple venues in most cases doesn’t require developing separate models for each specific case. The same goes for forecasting each separate product because we only need a suitable set of data that we can aggregate and properly feed to the model.\n\n5 KEY FACTORS AFFECTING DEMAND FORECASTING ACCURACY\n\nNow, speaking of the actual demand forecasting models, we need to discuss what external and internal factors can impact its work. Since the ML model will derive its prediction from past events, its prediction accuracy rate is unlikely to be 100%. However, by understanding the following things we can mitigate those risks on the stage of building the actual model.\n\n1. PRODUCT TYPES AND MODELING ERRORS\n\nThe product type is an important factor to consider for the demand forecasting model. For example, for a perishable item that has an actual demand of 100 cases, the prediction of selling 90 cases is preferred over the prediction of 110 cases. Missing the sales of 10 cases is a better result than wasting 10 cases, even though the actual error is the same percentage.\n\n2. SEASONALITY\n\nFor each product, the seasonality cycle plays a crucial role in predicting demand. For instance, if you sell tents for hiking, its seasonal growth in demand appears to be during the summer period, with peaks in a certain month in your area.\n\nIf we take the data for only 5 months for training the ML model, the prediction of the machine learning model won’t give accurate results, since we need a year’s data as a bare minimum, to calculate the seasonality.\n\nFor products that don’t fluctuate in demand seasonally, say forks and spoons, a three-month data will be enough to start training the model and producing forecasts. But it always depends on the item itself and other external factors like competition, or amount of holidays for a given period.\n\n3. REGIONAL IMPACTS ON MODEL PERFORMANCE\n\nDemand prediction models are strongly influenced by regional factors that include customer behavior and cultural determinants:\n\n4. NEW COMPETITORS ON THE MARKET\n\nDemand forecasting is a dynamic concept. The more competitors and product alternatives are present in the market, the harder demand forecasting becomes. The competition level contains sub-factors, such as the number of alternative products and competitors.\n\nSo, it is a very good idea to add this information dynamically to your demand forecasting model.\n\n5. ECONOMIC SITUATION\n\nThe state of the economy influences businesses and demand forecasting models. To put it more bluntly: periods of economic decline are likely to cause lower demand for expensive products, though sales of low-priced goods may go up. Therefore, an economic situation as well as trends aren’t external factors and should be considered when building artificial intelligence models.\n\nHOW TO START FORECASTING DEMAND WITH MACHINE LEARNING\n\nNow, let’s discuss the practical steps to implementing machine learning for demand or sales forecasting. So, before embarking on demand forecasting model development, you should understand the workflow of ML modeling. What follows offers a data-driven roadmap of how to optimize cooperation with software developers.\n\nSTEP 1. BRIEF DATA REVIEW\n\nThe first step when initiating the demand forecasting project is to provide the client with meaningful insights. The process includes the following steps:\n\nIn our experience, a few days is enough to understand the current situation and outline possible solutions. This is a part of data science exploration that comes with the involvement of the client to gather the data and provide the most relevant corporate storage.\n\nThis stage can be a part of the AI consulting process aimed at finding the best possible solution that syncs your business goals, tech capabilities, and market needs.\n\nAI CONSULTING SERVICES\n\nTurn your AI idea into a feasible software product\n\nSTEP 2. SETTING BUSINESS GOALS AND SUCCESS METRICS\n\nBefore coming to the stage of developing a demand forecasting solution, a software development team needs to agree with the client/business owner on the success metrics for the model’s results evaluation. Success metrics offer a clear definition of what is “valuable” within demand forecasting. A typical message might state:\n\n“I need a machine learning solution that predicts demand for […] products, for the next [week/month/a half-a-year/year], with […]% accuracy.”\n\nThis statement example will help you to identify what your success metrics will look like. You are expected to consider the following information:\n\nWhat types of products/product categories will you forecast?\n\nDifferent products/services should be considered and predicted independently for most cases. For example, the demand forecast for perishable products and subscription services coming at the same time each month will likely be different.\n\nWhat is the length of time for the demand forecast?\n\nShort-term forecasts are commonly done for less than 12 months – 1 week/1 month/6 months.\n\nThese forecasts may have the following purposes:\n\nLong-term forecasts are completed for periods longer than a year. The main purposes of long-term forecasts may include the following:\n\nWhat is the minimum expected percentage of demand forecast accuracy for making informed decisions?\n\nImplementing retail software development projects, we were able to reach an average accuracy level of 95.96% for positions with enough data. The minimum required forecast accuracy level is set depending on your business goals.\n\nExamples of metrics to measure the forecast accuracy are MAPE (Mean Absolute Percentage Error), MAE (Mean Absolute Error), or custom metrics.\n\nSTEP 3. DATA UNDERSTANDING & PREPARATION\n\nRegardless of what we’d like to predict, data quality is a critical component of an accurate demand forecast. The following data could be used for building forecasting models:\n\nWhen building a forecasting model, the data is evaluated according to the following parameters:\n\nIn reality, the data collected by companies often isn’t ideal. It usually needs to be cleaned, analyzed for gaps and anomalies, checked for relevance, and restored. That’s why data science consultants can be involved at this stage.\n\nData understanding is the next task once preparation and structuring are completed. It’s not modeling yet but an excellent way to understand data by visualization. Below you can see how we visualized the data understanding process:\n\nThis visualization demonstrates data decomposition, extracting trends, and seasonal or other factors from input data. It’s divided into several graphs:\n\nSTEP 4. MACHINE LEARNING FORECASTING MODEL DEVELOPMENT\n\nThere are no “one-size-fits-all” forecasting algorithms. The choice of machine learning models depends on several factors, such as business goal, data type, data amount and quality, forecasting period, etc.\n\nHowever, there are multiple approaches to that, and they are often combined under the hood of a single forecasting system. The following approaches are used for demand forecasting and proved to be the most efficient:\n\nThe topic of using ML models in analytical systems is much wider and covers not only retail cases. So if you want a much deeper insight into various models and approaches, read our dedicated article.\n\nRead more about:\n\nSTEP 5. PRODUCTIONALIZATION\n\nOnce we have the data, we can start the training, validation, and improvement procedures. This process is done iteratively until the model achieves the maximum desired results.\n\nA forecasting model can be used in its raw form, presenting its predictions in some sort of table, or sending mails with analytics for a certain period. However, more commonly we would also develop a front-end part of the application which is basically a dashboard that presents insights and visualizations through a single interface. It allows the user to query different reports, share them with the stakeholders, customize visualization types, etc. After testing and approval, the product is deployed into the production environment.\n\nOne thing to mention is that to keep the forecasting capabilities up to date, the model will require constant updates with new data. These can be your daily transactions or inventory turnover. For this purpose, we recommend setting up an automated pipeline that regularly aggregates recent data and updates the prediction model accordingly. It will help to keep the reliability of the developed demand forecasting model on a regular basis.\n\nRead also about:\n\nADDRESSING ANOMALIES AND UNPREDICTABLE SITUATIONS IN AI DEMAND FORECASTING\n\nAs the demand forecasting model processes historical data, it can’t know if the demand has radically changed. For example, if last year, we had one demand indicator for a certain type of consumer product, it can change next year due to economic turbulence, or supplier countries being cut off from exports.\n\nIn that case, there might be several ways to get an accurate forecast. Here are the five most common ways:\n\nDuring AI app development, artificial intelligence engineers analyze historical data for forecasting. This forecasting cannot predict the disruption caused by a global pandemic, a war, or a cataclysm, for example. Such an event requires the future recalibration of the machine learning models.\n\nBut keep in mind that after the demand situation normalizes after the pandemic/war/ etc – you need to adjust your model back, since in other cases – the model can remember the pandemic’s pattern and predict it for the next short-time period (e.g. next year).\n\nNow let’s take a look at our client’s success stories to learn how demand forecasting projects look in practice.\n\nSUCCESS STORY #1: IMPLEMENTING DATA SCIENCE DEMAND FORECASTING FOR A RETAIL POS SYSTEM\n\nAbout the client:\n\nComcash is a US-based ERP and POS system provider for the retail industry. Back in 2013, the company’s CEO Richard Stack engaged MobiDev to rebuild the old product into a robust cloud-based system operating both online and offline 24/7, regardless of internet connection.  Since then, the MobiDev team has been working with Comcash on the constant technical development of the solution, delivering advanced features to help the client achieve new heights in the market.\n\nBusiness goal:\n\nAfter turning the system into a cloud-based solution, we suggested Comcash implement the demand and sales forecasting modules to extend the POS functionality and gain additional competitive advantage.\n\nHow we delivered:\n\nWe implemented an adaptive selective model for demand forecasting that predicts demand for the coming weeks based on user retail sales data. The main challenge was to ensure a high level of adaptability of the model to allow users to obtain a forecast for specific products at any given time.\n\nTo do this, we used a combination of DS/ML libraries and methodologies such as Pandas and ABC-XYZ analysis.\n\nMoreover, a statistical report was generated to classify products based on popularity and profitability to help retailers identify the most profitable and least profitable products. This created the basis for advanced sales analytics and planning targeted discount strategies.\n\nOutcomes and achievements:\n\nThe increasing popularity of Comcash led to its acquisition by POS Nation in October 2022. Today, Comcash boasts a presence in over 3,000 locations and seamlessly integrates with a wide range of custom hardware.\n\n[Together with MobiDev], we’re able to work on a 24-hour development cycle, and we release software repeatedly faster than any of our competitors — and there is no overtime. We could never create what we have with MobiDev in my office in California. The tech market is just too competitive these days. If you are interested in developing a world-class product and working with a great group of friendly co-workers every day, I wholeheartedly recommend MobiDev.\n\nRichard Stack\n\nCEO of Comcash Inc.\n\nRead the Full Success Story:\n\nSUCCESS STORY #2: BUILDING AI DEMAND FORECASTING MODULE FOR VENUE CHAIN MANAGEMENT ECOSYSTEM\n\nAbout the client:\n\nSince 2014, MobiDev has been working with SmartTab, a US-based company providing POS systems for nightclubs and bars. SmartTab’s CEO contacted MobiDev to take over product development and improvement after his collaboration with another software vendor resulted in a pilot version of the app that fell short of expectations.\n\nFor over a decade of our joint work, the SmartTab system has expanded with new enhancements, including AI demand forecasting features.\n\nProject goal:\n\nAfter building the basic functionality of the POS system, the client was looking to enhance their product with an advanced dashboard allowing venue owners to analyze performance and make plans based on machine learning demand forecasting.\n\nHow we delivered:\n\nTo achieve the SmartTab project goals, we used a time series approach with a combination of Gradient Boosting and KNN models. The major components to analyze include trends, seasonality, irregularity, and cyclicity. With that, we can predict how much revenue will be earned within the next upcoming year with the daily granularity for each venue and total venue chain.\n\nUsers can view details on the product range of their venue in a few formats. This includes the pie chart, a 3×3 matrix, and trend-up/trend-down graphs to check the product’s popularity in a dynamic setting. This toolkit helps venue owners and managers make updates to the product range more effectively.\n\nOutcomes and achievements:\n\nSince the beginning of our cooperation in 2014, SmartTab has transformed from a bold startup to an industry leader that serves 1000+ venues and chains. We continue working with the client on product enhancements, including improvements in demand forecasting models.\n\nLEVERAGE AI DEMAND FORECASTING FOR YOUR BUSINESS WITH MOBIDEV\n\nOnce you decide to run a project on demand forecasting development, pay attention to the proficiency of a hired team.

Machine learning is also often referred to as predictive analytics, or predictive modelling.\n\nCoined by American computer scientist Arthur Samuel in 1959, the term ‘machine learning’ is defined as a “computer’s ability to learn without being explicitly programmed”.\n\nAt its most basic, machine learning uses programmed algorithms that receive and analyse input data to predict output values within an acceptable range. As new data is fed to these algorithms, they learn and optimise their operations to improve performance, developing ‘intelligence’ over time.\n\nThere are four types of machine learning algorithms: supervised, semi-supervised, unsupervised and reinforcement.\n\nSupervised learning\n\nIn supervised learning, the machine is taught by example. The operator provides the machine learning algorithm with a known dataset that includes desired inputs and outputs, and the algorithm must find a method to determine how to arrive at those inputs and outputs. While the operator knows the correct answers to the problem, the algorithm identifies patterns in data, learns from observations and makes predictions. The algorithm makes predictions and is corrected by the operator – and this process continues until the algorithm achieves a high level of accuracy/performance.\n\nUnder the umbrella of supervised learning fall: Classification, Regression and Forecasting.\n\nSemi-supervised learning\n\nSemi-supervised learning is similar to supervised learning, but instead uses both labelled and unlabelled data. Labelled data is essentially information that has meaningful tags so that the algorithm can understand the data, whilst unlabelled data lacks that information. By using this\ncombination, machine learning algorithms can learn to label unlabelled data.\n\nUnsupervised learning\n\nHere, the machine learning algorithm studies data to identify patterns. There is no answer key or human operator to provide instruction. Instead, the machine determines the correlations and relationships by analysing available data. In an unsupervised learning process, the machine learning algorithm is left to interpret large data sets and address that data accordingly. The algorithm tries to organise that data in some way to describe its structure. This might mean grouping the data into clusters or arranging it in a way that looks more organised.\n\nAs it assesses more data, its ability to make decisions on that data gradually improves and becomes more refined.\n\nUnder the umbrella of unsupervised learning, fall:\n\nReinforcement learning\n\nReinforcement learning focuses on regimented learning processes, where a machine learning algorithm is provided with a set of actions, parameters and end values. By defining the rules, the machine learning algorithm then tries to explore different options and possibilities, monitoring and evaluating each result to determine which one is optimal. Reinforcement learning teaches the machine trial and error. It learns from past experiences and begins to adapt its approach in response to the situation to achieve the best possible result.\n\nWhat machine learning algorithms can you use?\n\nChoosing the right machine learning algorithm depends on several factors, including, but not limited to: data size, quality and diversity, as well as what answers businesses want to derive from that data. Additional considerations include accuracy, training time, parameters, data points and much more. Therefore, choosing the right algorithm is both a combination of business need, specification, experimentation and time available. Even the most experienced data scientists cannot tell you which algorithm will perform the best before experimenting with others. We have, however, compiled a machine learning algorithm ‘cheat sheet’ which will help you find the most appropriate one for your specific challenges.\n\nWhat are the most common and popular machine learning algorithms?\n\nRead More\n\nSAS data and AI solutions provide our global customers with knowledge they can trust in the moments that matter, inspiring bold new innovations across industries.\n\nFollow Us\n\nWhat is...\n\nAbout cookies on this site\n\nThis site uses cookies and related technologies for site operation, analytics and third-party advertising purposes, as described in our SAS Privacy Statement.
