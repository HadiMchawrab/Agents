When it comes to machine learning in banking, leading financial institutions are harnessing ML's capabilities to streamline operations, enhance customer experience, bolster risk management, and improve financial forecasting.\n\nIn this article, we delve deeper into the application of machine learning in banking and for finance, exploring its opportunities, potential risks, use cases, benefits, and pivotal role in improving real-time fraud detection.\n\nMachine learning in banking and finance\n\nTo understand machine learning better, here are some examples of real-world machine learning models and algorithms in banking and finance.\n\nSifting through big data manually can take a lot of human effort and time. With the help of machine learning, a computer program that looks at this data can quickly identify patterns and automatically categorise this data – even making predictions or recommendations.\n\nFor example, machine learning can identify financial habits of a certain demographic, or flag potentially risky transactions that could be linked to fraud or scams to a bank’s compliance team. In addition, the time saved with automation can be better used on strategic analyses or quality customer interactions.\n\nIn which areas of banking/ finance is machine learning used?\n\nThe following is a summary of some of the ways machine learning is being used in, and how it impacts/ benefits the banking and finance industry:\n\nFor instance, DBS NAV Planner, a financial planning tool that aims to make financial advice easily accessible for our customers, comprises a suitability engine. The AI/ML models behind this tool are trained to recommend the right investment products to the right people, while also figuring out the best advice to give customers based on their individual profile.\n\nHow do banks benefit from machine learning?\n\nWith the above non-exhaustive use cases, it is seen that banks can benefit significantly from machine learning in various aspects of their operations, allowing them to enhance customer experiences, improve risk management, streamline operations, and drive revenue growth. Here’s a deeper dive into some areas of note:\n\nCustomer experience enhancement: machine learning algorithms enable banks to analyse customer data and behaviour (taking into consideration data protection and privacy laws) to provide personalised services and recommendations.\n\nCredit risk assessment: machine learning models help banks assess credit risk more accurately. They analyse vast datasets to identify patterns and predict the likelihood of loan defaults. By employing machine learning, a bank can make more nimble and more informed lending decisions while minimising risk and improving the quality of their loan portfolio.\n\nOperational efficiency: automation through machine learning reduces the need for manual intervention in routine banking processes. For instance, DBS Bank employs chatbots to assist customers with common inquiries and tasks, allowing human staff to focus on more complex issues. This improves operational efficiency and lowers costs.\n\nRevenue generation: machine learning could also help banks identify cross-selling and upselling opportunities. By analysing customer data, banks can recommend tailored financial products and services to their clients, whether via nudges or through a recommendation engine.\n\nDBS has leveraged machine learning to our advantage. We embarked on our digital transformation journey early in 2014, well ahead of our peers. In 2022, our AI/ML use cases delivered an economic value of SGD 180 million, comprising a revenue uplift of SGD150 million as well as SGD30 million from cost avoidance and productivity gains.\n\nOpportunities of machine learning in banking and finance\n\nMachine learning in banking offers immense opportunities. One of the most significant lies in understanding customer behaviour, which can improve customer experience. According to Harvard Business Review, machine learning holds much promise. Why? Because ML can predict customer behaviours.\n\nThe article notes, “By deploying ML to predict which content is most relevant for each individual, customers can receive better recommendations, less junk mail, very little inbox spam, and higher quality search results, among many other things. These improvements to customer experience aren’t only a nice-to-have, pleasant side-effect of profit-driven ML deployments. They pursue the raison d’etre of any company – to serve customers – and will ultimately translate into further benefits for the business. After all, a happier customer is a more loyal customer, and a higher customer retention rate means a higher customer growth rate.”\n\nAt DBS, we’ve created more than 600 artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning models that can, for instance, offer personalised product recommendations and celebrate our customers’ milestones. Today, our Consumer Banking Group sends out 45 million hyper-personalised nudges monthly to over five million customers across the region to guide them towards better investment and financial planning decisions.\n\nRisk management is another area where machine learning can make a substantial impact. The book, Disrupting Finance: FinTech and Strategy in the 21st Century, notes that the areas of consumer lending and small- and medium-sized enterprises (SME) lending involve large amounts of potential data and are increasingly relying on machine learning to make better lending decisions. The same goes for machine learning in managing market risk, and operational risk.\n\nDBS has been a frontrunner in using ML for risk management. AI/ML enables us to pro-actively provide SMEs with early alerts of credit risks, allowing SMEs to take pre-emptive action and nip potential credit issues in the bud. In 2022, we were able to successfully identify over 95% of non-performing SME loans at least three months before the businesses experienced credit stress. Over 80% of identified at-risk borrowers were averted from risk.\n\nRisks of machine learning in banking and finance\n\nDespite the numerous benefits that come with machine learning for the banking and finance sectors, this is not without risks. One of the main challenges of utilising ML is ensuring the privacy and security of customer data as banks increasingly rely on ML algorithms to process and analyse customer information.\n\nEY notes that “AI/ML early adopters face increased risks, such as lawsuits arising from the use of web-based copyrighted material in AI outputs, concerns about bias, lack of traceability due to the ‘black box’ nature of AI applications, and threats to data privacy and cybersecurity”.\n\nFor instance, while machine learning models are powerful, they are only as good as the data they are trained on, which may be biased or incomplete. Meanwhile, the lack of transparency and interpretability in some machine learning models (‘black boxes’) make it difficult for humans to understand how they make predictions.\n\nAt DBS, we implemented the PURE Framework – which assesses data use cases against PURE Principles (Purposeful, Unsurprising, Respectful, Explainable) – to ensure responsible data use across the bank. This has been further enabled through the development of an in-house assessment tool and overlaid with formal governance procedures, operating models, and the introduction of mandatory training.\n\nCan machine learning improve fraud detection in real time?\n\nMachine learning is revolutionising the way banks detect and prevent fraud. According to research, ML techniques have been applied very effectively to the problem of payments related fraud detection, and have the potential to evolve further, to detect previously unseen patterns of fraud. Even outside of banking and finance, ML has been used to detect potentially fraudulent activity, such as for Amazon Web Services credit card transactions.\n\nThe problem with traditional fraud detection systems is that it often struggles to keep up with the increasingly sophisticated tactics employed by fraudsters. However, machine learning models that are trained well can analyse transaction data in real-time, identify anomalous patterns, and flag potentially fraudulent activities.\n\nAt DBS, we have a dedicated anti-scam team with round-the-clock response capabilities to carry out intervention work, monitor and review fraud alerts. We carry out transaction screening with our monitoring and surveillance systems, which helps us detect unauthorised activities on customer accounts. With the aid of AI/ML, we can detect distinct changes in user behavioural patterns; cross-reference unusual account changes; as well as instantly screen and block flagged transfers.\n\nFrom June to July 2023, DBS worked with the Singapore Police Force, helping to disrupt more than 1,400 active scam cases. With the help of ML, we automated processes to significantly reduce the time taken to identify scam victims. We also leveraged technology to automate information sharing, information processing and the mass distribution of SMS alerts within a short time, improving outreach.\n\nIn the same vein, by adopting machine learning for finance, banks can enhance their fraud detection capabilities, reduce false positives, and react swiftly to suspicious activities, thereby minimising financial losses and maintaining customer trust.\n\nIn conclusion, machine learning in banking holds immense potential. As financial institutions continue to invest in this technology, we can expect to see further advancements in the way banks operate, manage risks, and serve their customers. However, it's crucial for banks to address the associated risks, particularly around data privacy and security, to fully harness the benefits of machine learning.\n\n|\n\nTechnology of the Future\n\nTerms of use\n\nPrivacy Policy\n",
