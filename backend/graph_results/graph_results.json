This study advances the field using cutting-edge machine learning techniques to model and predict various EV characteristics and performance metrics. Using a comprehensive dataset with parameters such as model year, make, model type, vehicle class, motor power, and energy consumption metrics, we tested classification and regression models to forecast categorical features (vehicle make, category) and continuous features (energy consumption, range, charge time, motor power). The models were assessed using key performance indicators like accuracy, recall, F1 score, precision, MAE, RMSE, and R2. The random forest and Naive Bayes classifiers excelled in classification tasks, achieving accuracies of 95.58% and 100%, respectively.

Various sectors contribute to these emissions, including transportation, energy, waste management, agriculture, forestry, and buildings [1,2,3,4,5,6,7]. The International Energy Agency identifies transportation as the second-largest GHG emitter, primarily emitting CO2, N2O, and CH4 [8, 9]. Transportation activities are responsible for 75% of global CO2 emissions [10], making emission reduction in this sector crucial for combating climate change [11]. Evaluating urban highways’ exposure to pollutants is essential for achieving social, environmental, and economic objectives, particularly in developing nations [12]. The significance of climate change is underscored by the declaration of a climate emergency by thirty-three countries as of January 2021 [13]. The transportation sector is a significant contributor to global energy consumption, accounting for over a quarter of the total [14]. Two-thirds of the world’s population is expected to reside in cities by 2050, according to UN estimates [15], which will increase demand for urban mobility as well as energy use and greenhouse gas emissions. Electric vehicles (EVs) offer a promising solution, potentially reducing carbon emissions by 45% compared to internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles [16]. Advances in reliability and battery range have boosted EV popularity and trust, with owner satisfaction on the rise [17, 18]. The proliferation of charging stations, driven by government initiatives, has further facilitated EV adoption, positioning them as a leading clean transportation option.\n\nThe growing use of electric vehicles requires exact forecasts of performance measures like energy consumption, charging time and driving range. These predictions can enhance the management of the electric grid and provide users with accurate data about their vehicle’s capabilities. Numerous studies have explored the development of models using machine learning techniques to enhance the reliability and accuracy of predicting these metrics. Using Gaussian mixture models, Lee et al. predicted the energy and duration requirements of over 30,000 non-residential EV charging sessions. They utilized historical charging data for testing and reported symmetric mean absolute percentage error (SMAPE) of 15.9% for energy consumption and 14.4% for session duration. To predict the departure and arrival times of electric vehicle (EV) users on a university campus, the authors in [19] utilized support vector machines (SVM). They achieved mean absolute percentage errors (MAPE) of 3.7% for the departure times and 2.9% for the arrival times. However, hyperparameter tuning for SVM was not addressed, and a simple persistence model was utilized for comparison. Frendo et al. [20] predicted EV departure times using regression models. Eight features were taken into account, including the vehicle ID, car model, charging point, weekday, parking floor, arrival time, and location. Artificial neural network, extreme gradient boosting, and linear regression were trained for prediction purpose. Extreme gradient boosting demonstrated the highest performance, with a mean absolute error (MAE) of 82 min. The prediction of session length and energy consumption was achieved through the use of an ensemble machine learning approach that integrated random forest, SVM, and kernel density estimator (KDE).This model, trained on historical charging records from both public and residential datasets, outperformed individual models with SMAPEs of 7.5% for consumption and 10.4% for duration [21].\n\nXiong et al. [22] estimated session start times and durations using mean values and subsequently applied linear regression to predict energy consumption. These predications were incorporated to stabilize the power system, and regulate the charging load albeit performance indicators were not statistically analyzed. In [23], regression models were applied to forecast energy demands at public charging stations across Nebraska, incorporating variables such as season, day of the week, type of location, and applicable fees. Extreme gradient boosting achieving an R2 score of 0.52, outperformed other models and attained a MAE of 4.6 kWh. The authors in [24] used the k-nearest neighbor (k-NN) algorithm to predict energy consumption at a university charging station. The study framed the problem as a time series, with the best results achieved by employing a K value of 1 (1-NN) and utilizing a time-weighted dissimilarity measure based on the dot product, yielding a SMAPE of 15.3%. Majidpour et al. [25] used algorithms like SVM and RF to forecast the energy requirements for the following day at charging stations. They also investigated pattern sequence-based forecasting (PSF) [26], which involves clustering days into categories before making predictions. The PSF method demonstrated the highest accuracy, achieving an average SMAPE of 14.1\n\nElectric vehicle (EV) range prediction has been examined using two main approaches: physical models, which utilize real-time data, and artificial intelligence models trained on historical data. Physical models can be subdivided into those that estimate energy consumption by either modeling the battery pack (or powertrain) or the vehicle itself. Battery pack models, for example, involve techniques that use the apparent state of discharge of Li-ion cells, adjusted for the effects of current and temperature. [27], and those updating a battery dynamics model using online battery identification parameters [28]. Battery-in-loop simulations have demonstrated effectiveness in assessing energy consumption under cold temperature conditions [29]. Simplified powertrain models have been created by utilizing drive cycle data tailored to specific scenarios, such as coast-down [30]. Battery pack models are particularly effective at incorporating energy use by auxiliary vehicle loads and considering the effects of ambient temperature [31]. Vehicle models, on the other hand, employ physical parameters like road inclination, velocity and vehicle mass [32, 33], providing statistical insights into a battery electric vehicle’s (BEV) instantaneous energy consumption. To forecast future energy consumption, additional road information has been utilized to compare results between higher driving speeds and the most fuel-efficient speeds [34]. While, the accuracy of these methods is contingent on having future route or drive cycle data, they cannot estimate energy consumption for the remaining portion of a trip without this information.\n\nDriving style has been identified as the most influential factor in the variable range of BEVs [35]. Consequently, historical vehicle data is required to estimate the remaining driving range accurately. Range prediction is a complex problem influenced by internal, external, constant, and variable parameters [36, 37]. Big-data models have been employed to forecast range using numerous data sources [38]. Most works leveraging artificial intelligence models combine historical vehicle data with GIS-based information [39] and other external factors like road conditions and traffic [40]. Data-driven approaches to estimating BEV range include predictive strategies based on optimal path search algorithms [41], solving multi-objective optimization problems to recommend vehicle speeds [42], and machine learning models that analyze trip data [43, 44]. Some methods incorporate additional attributes like tire-pressure monitoring with a physical energy consumption model for range estimation [45]. Recent studies have employed advanced machine learning techniques such as light gradient boosting and extreme gradient boosting, using features like motor, battery temperature, battery energy, and driving patterns to determine BEV range [46]. Additionally, least squares support vector machine models have been combined with particle swarm optimization, trained on features such as temperature and depth of discharge, to achieve stable and reliable range predictions [47].\n\nThe increasing use of electric vehicles (EVs) necessitates precise forecasting of performance metrics to improve user experience and aid infrastructure planning. This research introduces a multimodel prediction framework that predicts electric vehicle specifications accurately, considering factors like make, category, energy consumption, motor power, travel range, and charging time. The framework employs machine learning algorithms to provide precise predictions, enabling efficient management of the electric grid, infrastructure development, and promoting the widespread adoption of electric vehicles. This research significantly contributes to the prediction of electric vehicle (EV) performance by utilizing various classification and regression models. This study uses machine learning techniques to predict key EV characteristics using data on vehicle make, category, energy consumption, motor power, travel range, and charging time. The main contributions of this research include:\n\nThe study employs various regression and classification techniques to accurately predict electric vehicle specifications, including make, category, energy consumption, motor power, travel range, and charging time.\n\nThe study aims to verify the reliability of classification techniques in accurately predicting the make and category of a vehicle.\n\nThe study employs regression models that accurately predict energy consumption, motor power, travel range, and charging time with low error metrics.\n\nThe study aims to assess the effectiveness of each regression or classification model through various metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, MAE, root mean square error (RMSE), and R-squared (R2).\n\nThe study aims to provide valuable insights to aid policymakers and stakeholders in devising effective strategies for the adoption and infrastructure planning of electric vehicles.\n\nThis research aligns with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals, specifically supporting Goal 13, “climate action,” and indirectly aiding in achieving other related objectives.\n\nThe study emphasizes the significance of utilizing classification and regression methods to comprehend and predict electric vehicle specifications, thereby promoting the adoption of eco-friendly transportation methods.\n\n2 Materials and methods\n\nThe quality and comprehensiveness of the dataset are crucial for efficient work and accurate predictions of electric vehicle characteristics using machine learning models. This research utilized a dataset containing parameters related to EV performance, including model year, make, vehicle class, energy consumption, motor power, travel range, and charging time. The dataset, compiled from recent sources, accurately predicts categorical and continuous EV characteristics, providing a detailed snapshot of the EV market and capturing a wide range of vehicle specifications and performance metrics. The study’s features are shown in Table 1, while Tables 2 and 3 provide an overview and statistical summary of the dataset. The dataset is crucial for creating robust machine learning models to predict energy efficiency, driving range, and charging time, thereby advancing EV technology and infrastructure planning.\n\n2.1 Dataset\n\nThe dataset displays official records of various vehicular features, including comprehensive information about the specifications of electric vehicles such as model year, make, model, vehicle class, motor power (kW), and energy consumption metrics in different driving conditions (city, highway, combined). It provides an overview of the energy efficiency and performance of electric vehicles in terms of kWh per 100 km and liters equivalent (Le) per 100 km as shown in Table 1. The data appears to have been properly compiled according to the most recent and applicable information. The dataset includes features such as motor power (kW), energy consumption metrics (City, Highway, Combined) in kWh/100 km and Le per 100 km, with data types ranging from int64 for integral values to float64 for floating-point numbers. The table also introduces vehicle range (km) and recharge time (h), providing a more comprehensive understanding of each electric vehicle’s performance and efficiency.\n\nCurrently, the time span for the displayed vehicles is between 2012 and 2024. The dataset has 13 columns and 6720 rows. It presents a vast array of information about automotive specifications and energy consumption for electric vehicles. The dataset offers a detailed snapshot of the automotive sector’s environmental impact and performance, encompassing 6720 records from 33 distinct manufacturers and 373 unique models. This collection showcases the variety of the electric vehicle market, highlighting Tesla as the predominant manufacturer with 158 entries, and the Bolt EV as the most frequently listed model, appearing 7 times. The dataset reflects the current shift towards more efficient vehicles, with the ‘Sport utility vehicle: Standard’ category leading in representation with 140 instances. It includes comprehensive details on each vehicle’s make and model, class, motor power, and energy consumption in different driving conditions. These insights are concisely shown in Table 2.\n\nEnergy consumption and range are pivotal in assessing the performance and environmental impact of electric vehicle models. The dataset provides detailed insights, with average energy consumption for city, highway, and combined conditions noted at 21.57, 23.66, and 22.52 kWh per 100 kms respectively. The mean Le for city, highway, and combined conditions are 2.43, 2.66, and 2.53  respectively. The dataset covers a wide range of vehicle models with motor power ranging from 35 to 930 kW and driving ranges from 92 to 837 km. The average recharge time is approximately 10.16 h. Therefore, it captures the diversity of the electric vehicle market. A comprehensive Table 3 provides the statistical summary of the vehicle data in the dataset, and it encompasses such important features as model year, motor power, energy consumption, equivalent fuel consumption, range, and recharge time. Such characteristics are critical for the development of machine learning models to predict energy efficiency and driving range, which would be used to develop more efficient and user-friendly electric vehicle technologies.\n\nHeatmap of correlation coefficients highlighting relationships between electric vehicle attributes and energy consumption\n\nThe heatmap shown in Fig. 1 showcases the interdependencies among various vehicular attributes. Notably, there is a pronounced positive correlation (correlation coefficient \\(\\ge 0.9\\)) between city energy consumption (city_kwh), highway energy consumption (Highway_kwh), and combined energy consumption (Comb_kwh). This indicates that vehicles consuming more energy in urban settings tend to have higher consumption on highways and overall. Additionally, the range of the vehicle shows a strong positive correlation with motor power (\\(\\textit{r} = 0.67\\)) and recharge time (\\(\\textit{r} = 0.7\\)), suggesting that more powerful motors and longer recharge times are associated with extended driving ranges. Conversely, the correlation between highway energy consumption and vehicle range (\\(\\textit{r} = 0.05\\)) is relatively weak. These insights highlight the relationships between energy consumption metrics and other vehicle attributes, which are critical for understanding the performance and efficiency of electric vehicles.\n\nComparative analysis of range and charge time by vehicle make, class, and model\n\nFigure 2 provides a comprehensive overview of range and charge time across various categories within the electric vehicle landscape. Delving into range by make, while brands like Lucid and Rivian show impressive ranges, it’s Lucid that emerges as the top performer, underscoring the advancements in battery technology and efficiency. In the realm of vehicle classes, the Pickup truck: Standard category takes the lead in range, highlighting the potential for long-distance travel in larger vehicles. Regarding models, the Air Grand Touring AWD (21” Wheels) model stands out with the highest range, reflecting the impact of specific design and engineering choices on vehicle performance. On the other side, charge time analysis reveals that makes like Fisker and Rivian require longer charging times, with Fisker leading in this aspect. In terms of vehicle classes, the Pickup truck: Standard category again leads with the longest charge times, aligning with the larger battery capacities required. Among models, the Ocean Ultra shows the longest charge time, indicative of its extensive battery system. These insights highlight the varying performance and efficiency characteristics of electric vehicles across different makes, classes, and models, providing a detailed understanding of the current electric vehicle market.\n\nThe vehicles in the dataset are categorized into Luxury, Premium, Sports, and General categories, as shown in Table 4, reflecting the market structure and consumer perceptions. This segmentation plays a crucial role in analytical processes such as generating box plots to visually display data distribution, highlighting central tendencies and variations within each group. By comparing these graphs, one can identify patterns and outliers essential for assessing and comparing CO2 emissions levels across these different categories. The plot in Fig. 3 illustrates the range for Luxury, Premium, Sports, and General vehicles. The range is measured on the vertical axis ranging from 0 to 800. Each category’s details are presented through boxes indicating the interquartile range and whiskers representing the full range of values. Noticeably, outliers can be seen in the Premium and Sports segments. This visualization effectively contrasts the distributions by accentuating both the variability and central tendencies within the range data. It indicates that Luxury cars demonstrate a higher range with a broader interquartile range, while general vehicles exhibit a lower range with a narrower interquartile range. In contrast, General cars have the lowest range with a narrower interquartile range. The ranges for Premium and Sports cars fall in between, with Premium cars tending towards a higher range than Sports ones.\n\nBoxplot of range by vehicle make type\n\nBoxplot of charge time by vehicle make type\n\nThe plot in Fig. 4 illustrates the charge time for Luxury, Premium, Sports, and General vehicles. The charge time is measured on the vertical axis ranging from 4 to 18 h. Each category’s details are presented through boxes indicating the interquartile range and whiskers representing the full range of values.

Each category’s details are presented through boxes indicating the interquartile range and whiskers representing the full range of values. Noticeably, outliers can be seen in the General and Sports segments. This visualization effectively contrasts the distributions by accentuating both the variability and central tendencies within the motor power data. It indicates that Luxury cars demonstrate higher motor power with a broader interquartile range, while General vehicles exhibit lower motor power with a narrower interquartile range. The motor power for Premium and Sports cars falls in between, with Premium cars tending towards higher motor power than Sports ones.\n\nBoxplot of motor power by vehicle make type\n\nThe Table 5 organizes different vehicle types into four main categories: Sedan, SUV, Hatchback, and Truck. This categorization simplifies the classification system, facilitating easier analysis and comparison of vehicles based on their features. The ’Sedan’ category encompasses a range of passenger cars from midsize to full-size, including two-seaters. ’SUV’ includes both small and standard sport utility vehicles, reflecting their shared design and utility features. The ’Hatchback’ class captures the smaller, more compact vehicles, while the ’Truck’ category groups together larger utility vehicles designed for passenger and cargo transport, including station wagons and standard pickup trucks.\n\nThe box plot in Fig. 6 illustrates the range for Hatchback, Sedan, SUV, and Truck vehicle categories. The range is measured on the vertical axis ranging from 0 to 800 kms. Each category’s details are presented through boxes indicating the interquartile range and whiskers representing the full range of values. Noticeably, outliers can be seen in the Sedan and Truck segments. This visualization effectively contrasts the distributions by accentuating both the variability and central tendencies within the range data. It indicates that Sedans demonstrate a broader range with several high outliers, while Hatchbacks exhibit a more consistent range with a narrower interquartile range. SUVs fall in between, with a moderate interquartile range and fewer outliers. Trucks show a significant range in their values, including some high outliers. This visual representation underscores the diversity in vehicle ranges within different categories.\n\nBoxplot of range by vehicle categories\n\nThe box plot in Fig. 7 illustrates the charge time for Hatchback, Sedan, SUV, and Truck vehicle categories. The charge time is measured on the vertical axis ranging from 4 to 18 h. Each category’s details are presented through boxes indicating the interquartile range and whiskers representing the full range of values. The variability in charge time is largely due to differences in battery sizes and charging technology among vehicle categories. For instance, larger vehicles or those with higher battery capacities typically require longer charging times, while some advanced models offer fast-charging capabilities, leading to shorter times. Noticeably, outliers can be seen in the Truck segment. This visualization effectively contrasts the distributions by accentuating both the variability and central tendencies within the charge time data. It indicates that SUVs and Sedans demonstrate a higher charge time with broader interquartile ranges, while Hatchbacks exhibit a lower charge time with a narrower interquartile range. Trucks show a significant range in their values, including some high outliers. This visual representation underscores the diversity in charge times within different vehicle categories.\n\nBoxplot of charge time by vehicle categories\n\nThe box plot in Fig. 8 illustrates the motor power for Hatchback, Sedan, SUV, and Truck vehicle categories. The motor power is measured on the vertical axis ranging from 0 to 800 kW. Each category’s details are presented through boxes indicating the interquartile range and whiskers representing the full range of values. Noticeably, outliers can be seen in the Sedan and SUV segments. This visualization effectively contrasts the distributions by accentuating both the variability and central tendencies within the motor power data. It indicates that Sedans demonstrate a higher motor power with several high outliers, while Hatchbacks exhibit a more consistent motor power with a narrower interquartile range. SUVs and Trucks fall in between, with SUVs having a broader range and Trucks showing a significant range in their values, including some high outliers. This visual representation underscores the diversity in motor power within different vehicle categories.\n\nBoxplot of motor power by vehicle categories\n\nFigure 9 shows the statistics of Range and Charge Time for all the vehicles. The mean range value is approximately 425.54, which indicates the average distance a vehicle can travel on a single charge. The median range value is 427.0, suggesting that half of the vehicles have a range below this value and half above. The most common range value in the dataset is 383, indicating it appears most frequently. The close proximity of the mean and median values suggests a relatively symmetric distribution of data around the central value. The mean charge time value is approximately 10.16, which indicates the average time required to fully charge a vehicle. The median charge time value is 10.0, suggesting that half of the vehicles have a charge time below this value and half above. The most common charge time value in the dataset is 12.0. The close proximity of the mean and median values, along with their relationship to the mode, provides insights into the distribution of charge times across different vehicles. Moreover, the narrow range observed in the violin plot could indicate consistent charge times across various models, reflecting standardization in charging technology. It may also be partly due to the data cleaning process, where outliers were removed using the IQR method, resulting in a more condensed data distribution.\n\nViolin-plots of range and charge time statistics\n\nTable 6 shows the outliers present in the dataset. The ’Model year’ column has 11 outliers, indicating some variation in the years represented. The ’Motor’ column has 18 outliers, which may reflect extreme values in motor capacity. The ’City (kWh/100 km)’ and ’Combined (kWh/100 km)’ columns have 6 and 8 outliers respectively, while the ’Highway (kWh/100 km)’ column has 23 outliers, indicating variability in energy consumption during highway driving. The ’City (Le/100 km)’, ’Highway (Le/100 km)’, and ’Combined (Le/100 km)’ columns also show outliers, with the ’Highway (Le/100 km)’ column having the most at 23 outliers. The ’Range’ column has 49 outliers, reflecting significant variability in vehicle range. Interestingly, the ’Charge time’ column has no outliers, indicating a consistent charging time across the dataset.\n\nThese outliers were removed using the Interquartile Range (IQR) method. This IQR method ensures the integrity of the dataset by filtering out data points that deviate from the central trend. The IQR is computed as the difference between the third quartile (\\(Q_3\\)) and the first quartile (\\(Q_1\\)), defined as \\(\\text {IQR} = Q_3 - Q_1\\). Any data point below \\(Q_1 - 1.5 \\times \\text {IQR}\\) or above \\(Q_3 + 1.5 \\times \\text {IQR}\\) is classified as an outlier. After excluding outliers using the IQR method, Fig. 10 highlights the updated values for the mean, mode, and median. The mean (\\(\\bar{x}\\)), which is sensitive to extreme values, shifted closer to the central data cluster. The mode remained stable due to its resistance to outliers. The median (\\(m\\)), indicating the middle value of the ordered data, also adjusted slightly, aligning more closely with the densest part of the data distribution. In the case of ’Range,’ there were 49 outliers, resulting in a noticeable change in the violin plot with the maximum range reduced to approximately 700. For ’Charge Time,’ with zero outliers, the violin plot remained unchanged.\n\nImproved violin-plots of range and charge time statistics\n\n3 Evaluation metrics and results analysis\n\nThe performance of each model was assessed using multiple metrics to determine their generalization capabilities and accuracy in predicting unseen data.\n\n3.1 Evaluation metrics\n\nBefore exploring each metric in detail, it is crucial to understand the main evaluation criteria used to measure the performance of classification models. The following metrics were utilized for this purpose:\n\nAccuracy: Measures the proportion of correctly classified instances.\n\nRecall (Sensitivity): Measures the ability to correctly identify positive instances out of all actual positive instances.\n\nPrecision: Measures the proportion of correctly identified positive instances out of all instances classified as positive.\n\nF1 Score: Harmonic mean of precision and recall, providing a balance between the two.\n\nKappa: Measures the agreement between predicted and actual outcomes, considering chance agreement.\n\nMatthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC): Measures the quality of binary classifications, considering true and false positives and negatives.\n\nTraining Time (TT): Represents the time taken by each model to train on the given data.\n\nTo assess the performance of regression models, the following metrics were used:\n\nMean Absolute Error (MAE): Measures the average magnitude of errors in predictions, without considering their direction. It is the average over the test sample of the absolute differences between prediction and actual observation, where all individual differences have equal weight.\n\n, where \\(y_i\\) is the actual value and \\(\\hat{y}_i\\) is the predicted value.\n\nMean Squared Error (MSE): Measures the average of the squares of the errors, which is the average squared difference between the estimated values and the actual value. It gives a higher weight to large errors.\n\nRoot Mean Squared Error (RMSE): Measures the square root of the average of squared differences between prediction and actual observation. It represents the standard deviation of the residuals (prediction errors).\n\nR-squared (R2): Represents the proportion of the variance for a dependent variable that’s explained by an independent variable or variables in a regression model.\n\n, where \\(\\bar{y}\\) is the mean of the actual values.\n\nRoot Mean Squared Logarithmic Error (RMSLE): Measures the ratio between the predicted and the actual value and helps penalize under-predictions more than over-predictions.\n\nMean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE): Measures the average of the absolute percentage errors of predictions. It expresses accuracy as a percentage.\n\n3.2 Results analysis\n\nIn this section, we will predict vehicle characteristics using both classification and regression models. The categorical features like vehicle make and vehicle class, will be predicted using classification models. On the other hand, continuous variables such as range, charge time and motor power will be predicted using regression models. By utilizing both classification and regression models, we can thoroughly analyze and predict multiple aspects of vehicle characteristics and their environmental impact.\n\nTo predict vehicles based on different make types shown in Tables 4, 7 provides a mapping of these make types. Each category is assigned a unique numerical identifier, establishing a standardized representation for the classification task. Table 8 displays the performance metrics for various classification models used to predict vehicle make types. The random forest classifier provides the best results with an accuracy of 95.58%, supported by its high values in recall, precision, F1 score, Kappa, and MCC, all around the 95% mark, highlighting its capabilities on unseen data. The random forest classifier was tuned through grid search to optimize hyperparameters such as the number of trees, depth of each tree, and the minimum number of samples required to split a node. This optimization improved the model’s generalization on the test data, contributing to its superior performance. The Naive Bayes and extra trees classifiers also show strong performance with accuracies of 95.31% and 95.10%, respectively, and similarly high values in recall, precision, F1 score, Kappa, and MCC. Decision tree classifier and Extreme Gradient Boosting also perform well with accuracies of 91.60%. Light Gradient Boosting Machine shows reliable performance with an accuracy of 87.41%. Conversely, models like SVM with a linear kernel and the dummy classifier show significantly lower accuracies of 40.34% and 37.44%, respectively, reflecting poor predictive performance. Similarly, Ada boost classifier and Logistic Regression exhibit relatively lower accuracies at 78.34% and 80.82%, respectively. Considering training time, Linear Discriminant Analysis stands out with a relatively low training time of 0.126 s, making it computationally efficient compared to models like gradient boosting classifier, which takes significantly longer at 1.383 s. Thus, random forest classifier is the best performer in accurately predicting vehicle make type while Linear Discriminant Analysis offers a balance between accuracy and computational efficiency.\n\nFigure 11 represents a confusion matrix for the best-performing random forest classifier, detailing the performance of the classifier across four vehicle make types: General, Luxury, Premium, and Sports. The matrix serves as a comprehensive tool for evaluating the classifier’s accuracy by juxtaposing actual class labels against predicted ones. Each cell in the matrix quantifies the instances of true class labels (rows) being classified into predicted class labels (columns). Diagonal elements, highlighted in green, signify correctly classified instances, while off-diagonal elements indicate misclassifications. The random forest classifier demonstrates robust performance, evidenced by the majority of instances lying along the diagonal, indicating high accuracy. Specifically, the General category has the most instances with 41 correctly classified samples. Other categories also exhibit high instance counts: Luxury with 4 correctly classified samples, Premium with 66, and Sports with 50 correctly classified samples. However, there are some misclassifications, such as 8 instances of General vehicles being classified as premium and 3 instances of Luxury vehicles being classified as premium. Additional steps to reduce misclassification could include incorporating more features that differentiate vehicle makes, such as charging technology or body style. Employing advanced ensemble techniques, like stacking multiple classifiers, could also help improve classification accuracy. The sparse off-diagonal elements further affirm the classifier’s efficacy, showcasing minimal misclassifications. This matrix allows for an in-depth understanding of the classifier’s strengths and weaknesses across different categories, providing essential insights for refining model performance and addressing specific areas of improvement.\n\nConfusion matrix for random forest classifier\n\nTo predict vehicles based on different vehicle categories, the Table 9 provides a mapping of various vehicle categories. Each category is assigned a unique numerical identifier, establishing a standardized representation for the classification task.\n\nTable 10 shows the performance metrics for the several classification models used to forecast vehicle categories. Naive Bayes achieved an accuracy of 100.00%, with excellent recall, precision, F1 score, Kappa, and Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC) scores, indicating its high capacity to generalize to unknown data. Similarly, both ridge classifier and extra trees classifier achieved an accuracy of 100.00%, further supported by their perfect recall, precision, F1 score, Kappa, and MCC values. Random forest classifier demonstrated strong performance with an accuracy of 99.51%. Logistic Regression (LR) performs well with an accuracy of 92.37%.\n\nGradient boosting classifier and light gradient boosting machine exhibit high predictive skills, with accuracies of 77.83% and 88.43%, respectively. Extreme gradient boosting also achieves good performance with an accuracy of 82.04%. The decision tree classifier shows an accuracy of 83.99%, performing well with good recall, precision, F1 score, Kappa, and MCC values. On the other hand, models with poorer predictive ability, such as the dummy classifier and Support Vector Machine (SVM) with a linear kernel, show much lower accuracies of 42.62% and 37.91%, respectively. The accuracies of the Ada boost classifier and the K neighbors classifier are comparatively lower at 74.65% and 54.24%, respectively. When it comes to computational efficiency, the quadratic and linear discriminant analysis with a very short training time of 0.127 s, is significantly more efficient compared to models like the gradient boosting classifier, which requires 0.742 s. Even though light gradient boosting machine isn’t as accurate as some top-performing models, it still shows effective training times. In conclusion, the decision tree classifier offers a balance between accuracy and computational efficiency, while the ridge and extra trees classifiers stand out for their superior performance in accurately identifying vehicle categories based on the provided data.\n\nFigure 12 shows the confusion matrix for the Naive Bayes classifier, illustrating the model’s performance in predicting vehicle categories. The matrix compares the true class labels against the predicted labels, with the x-axis representing the predicted classes and the y-axis representing the true classes. For the Hatchback category, the model correctly predicted 21 instances with no misclassifications. For the SUV category, the model accurately predicted 74 instances, again with no errors. The Sedan category saw 69 correct predictions and no misclassifications. However, the Truck category had 10 correct predictions but also showed no errors. The confusion matrix highlights the classifier’s strong performance, as evidenced by the diagonal cells showing the total number of correct predictions for each class, while the off-diagonal cells, which would indicate misclassifications, are all zeros. This confirms that the Naive Bayes classifier achieved high performance metrics, including accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, Kappa, and Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC). Such results demonstrate the model’s robust performance in distinguishing between the various vehicle categories.\n\nConfusion matrix for ridge classifier\n\nTable 11 presents the performance metrics of various regression models used for predicting energy consumption in the city.

Predicting EV sales is momentous for stakeholders, including car manufacturers, policymakers, and fuel suppliers. The data used in the modeling process significantly affects the prediction model’s quality. This research’s primary dataset contains monthly sales and registrations of 357 new vehicles in the United States of America from 2014 to 2020. In addition to this data, several web crawlers were used to gather the required information. Vehicles sale were predicted using long short-term memory (LSTM) and Convolutional LSTM (ConvLSTM) models. To enhance LSTM performance, the hybrid model with a new structure called “Hybrid LSTM with two-dimensional Attention and Residual network” has been proposed. Also, all three models are built as Automated Machine Learning models to improve the modeling process. The proposed hybrid model performs better than the other models based on the same evaluation units, including Mean Absolute Percentage Error, Normalized Root Mean Square Error, R-square, slope, and intercept of fitted linear regressions. The proposed hybrid model has been able to predict the share of EVs with an acceptable Mean Absolute Error of 3.5%.\n\nSimilar content being viewed by others\n\nDeep learning model based prediction of vehicle CO2 emissions with eXplainable AI integration for sustainable environment\n\nDevelopment and evaluation of bidirectional LSTM freeway traffic forecasting models using simulation data\n\nBayesian optimization and deep learning for steering wheel angle prediction\n\nIntroduction\n\nEmissions of greenhouse gases are increasing rapidly worldwide. According to a United States Environmental Protection Agency report released in 2020, the transportation sector produces about 27% of the entire greenhouse gas emissions in the country, which, compared to other sectors, transportation emits the most greenhouse gases1. EVs were introduced as an alternative to gasoline and diesel cars to reduce air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions, optimize the use of natural energy resources and protect the environment. Using electricity generated from renewable energy sources such as wind, water and sunlight for EVs can be one of the most efficient solutions to reduce emissions and climate change2. Although much time has passed since the invention of EVs, internal combustion vehicles are still the most popular. EV sales have been on the rise, and in January 2017, the total number of EVs sold worldwide reached two million3. Globally, EV sales accounted for 9% of the car market in 2021, a fourfold increase from 20194.\n\nDesigning and producing vehicles is time-consuming and requires much investment, so by predicting the number of sales, automobile companies can optimize production, Furthermore, by accurately predicting the penetration of EVs in the market, it is possible to estimate their impact on reducing pollution in the coming years, which is very important from an environmental standpoint. Forecasting the sale of EVs and their penetration into the automotive market has been a significant issue for governments, policymakers, and car manufacturers to plan the production of EVs, set proper policies, and provide sufficient energy and infrastructure.\n\nThe main goal of this research is to apply Machine Learning (ML) methods to build an efficient prediction model to estimate the sale of all vehicles in the dataset, the share of EVs in each segment, and determine the main factors that influence the sales of each EV. The effect of a limited number of influencing factors on vehicle sales was examined in previous studies using different models. For this study, a wide range of information was collected, including all factors that previous studies have proven are related to car sales, and it was used in modeling. LSTM and ConvLSTM, powerful Deep Learning (DL) models, have been used for predicting vehicle sales. By combining the two-dimensional Attention model and the Residual network as the proposed hybrid model, it has been tried to improve the performance of the LSTM model. Additionally, using the collected information and the model sensitivity analysis, it was attempted to determine the most influential factors on the sale of each EV.\n\nThe literature review of this study includes two general sections. The first section examines ML methods used to predict vehicle sales, and the second section provides an overview of the features used in other methods to predict EV sales.\n\nML methods in predicting vehicle sales\n\nSeveral studies have used ML methods to predict the sales of EVs as time-series data. Multiple Linear Regression and Support Vector Machine (SVM) models were compared for predicting vehicle sales using yearly, quarterly and monthly data (the number of new automobile registrations, the number of automobile sales, and economic indicators such as Gross Domestic Product (GDP), Available Personal Income, Consumer Price Index, Interest Rate, Unemployment Rate, Industrial Investment Demand, Petroleum Charge, Private Consumption, and Latent Replacement Demand) in a study by Brühl et al.5 According to the results, the SVM model had better performance based on the error values (Mean Absolute Error and Mean Absolute Percentage Error), was more interpretable, and gave better results based on quarterly data. In the study of Wang et al. ML techniques were used to predict car sales based on sales quantity, economic indicators, wholesale population, unemployment rate, exchange rate, the prices of vehicles, the oil prices, and the prices of vehicle components. Based on evaluation units (R-square and Mean Squared Error), they evaluated the prediction quality of adaptive network-based fuzzy inference system (ANFIS), Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), and autoregressive integrated moving average models; the results showed that ANFIS performed better than the other models6. In another study, Hülsmann et al. compared the performance of linear models, such as Ordinary Least Squares and Quantile Regression, against ML methods like SVM, Decision Tree, k–Nearest Neighbor, and Random Forest for predicting vehicle sales. Based on the monthly data of vehicle sales, new car registrations, and economic indicators (such as GDP, Personal Income and Dow Jones), the Decision Tree of ML methods performed better than the other models based on Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE)7.\n\nMoreover, Kitabci et al. analysed the impact of economic policies on vehicle sales in Turkey as a macro-environmental factor by multiple regression and neural network methods. They assessed factors such as the vehicle loan rate presented by the banks, the income of the consumers, the tax deductions made by the government for the automobile, the inflation rate, automobile prices, the euro exchange rate, oil prices, and advertisements spent by the businesses. According to the results, neural networks were more accurate in predicting sales than regression models; some factors, including the euro exchange rate, the rates of vehicle loans offered by banks, and the government's tax deductions, have influenced automobile sales8. In another research, Bas et al. applied classification ML methods to predict EV adoption using ride-sourcing factors, underlying sociodemographics, and vehicle characteristics; they examined the contributions of different factors to predict outcomes using a method called “Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations”. Based on the study’s findings, ML models produced highly accurate predictions regarding EV adoption, and the frequent usage of ride-sourcing, knowledge about EVs, and environmental protection awareness were significant factors in explaining the tendency to adopt EVs9. In addition, Zhang et al. applied Singular Spectrum Analysis as a univariate time-series model and the Vector Auto-Regression model (VAR) as a multivariate model for forecasting EV sales. According to the results, the VAR model can significantly improve the prediction accuracy because it considers the effect of economic indicators, such as consumer prices, consumer confidence, producers' prices, fuel and vehicle prices, and Baidu data (An indicator of consumer interest and curiosity in EVs)10.\n\nIn another study, Kaya et al.11 used the exchange rate, the GDP, the Consumer Confidence Index, the Consumer Price Index data and a Deep Neural Network model to predict vehicle sales; the results revealed that this ML model predicted sales accurately (based on Mean Squared Error). In another research, Xia et al. introduced the ForeXGBoost model, a vehicle sales prediction system based on large-scale datasets containing comprehensive vehicle information, including brand ID, model, engine power, and displacement. Based on Logarithmic Difference Square Root, MAPE, and running time, the XGBoost model outperforms benchmark algorithms like Linear Regression and Gradient Boosting Decision Trees12. Using online survey data and ML methods such as SVM, ANN, Deep Neural Networks, Gradient Boosting Models, and Random Forests, Bas et al. compared different methods for classifying potential EV buyers and identifying the features that affect the adoption of EVs. Results showed that the SVM model outperforms the other algorithms; having only partial information (e.g. only socioeconomic factors) reduces model performance, while synergy across multiple variables increases accuracy13. Additionally, Saxena et al. present a study that examines the use of deep learning-based models, including Autoregressive Integration Moving Averages and LSTM models, to predict future directions of vehicle sales. Based on the implementation results, the MAE and the Root Mean Square Error for LSTM-based time series forecasting were reduced, and this model could accurately predict green vehicle sales14.\n\nFactors affecting the sale of EVs in other methods\n\nDeveloping policies requires understanding users' behavior and prioritizing their choices. Therefore, some previous studies used survey data to predict EV demand. To assess the potential demand for EVs, Beggs et al.15 used survey data and vehicle specifications, such as seat capacity, maximum speed, purchase price, and operating costs. In a similar study, the demand for EVs was estimated based on consumer preferences for vehicle attributes by Calfee et al.16 The results of this research have shown that the weak performance of EVs limits their demand; however, if EVs become significantly more advanced than other cars or if gasoline becomes scarce, the demand for these vehicles will increase.\n\nPredicting the future demand for EVs is a complex issue. As most studies for new technologies rely on survey data, market share predictions will reflect the share in the survey data, not the actual market share. Consumer opinions and the news published about EVs also influence the sales of these vehicles. Based on Mau et al.17 research, EV sales are impacted by published information about the penetration rate of EVs, known as the “The neighbor effect”. Electric vehicles' specifications are another factor affecting their sales. According to Balducci et al.18 study to assess plug-in hybrid EV penetration scenarios in the auto market, fuel economy and reduced motor vehicle emissions are the most important factors when purchasing hybrid EVs, while insufficient engine power, high price, and unreliability are the most important reasons for not purchasing these vehicles. Furthermore, Hess et al. used vehicle specifications such as purchase price, vehicle purchase incentives, Miles Per Gallon (MPG) or equivalent, fuel cost per year, fuel availability, refueling time, driving range, maintenance cost per year, and acceleration to explore consumers' preferences in choosing the type of vehicle and the type of fuel. The results have shown that consumers' choices are adversely affected by factors such as purchase price, operating cost, and vehicle age, whereas their choices are positively affected by factors such as better vehicle acceleration, purchase incentives, driving range, and fuel availability19.\n\nThe sale of EVs is also affected by improving vehicle engine performance and reducing fuel consumption. Using a discrete choice model, Bas et al. investigated EV penetration in the face of new technology for reducing fuel consumption. Results demonstrated a clear tradeoff between the cost of a gasoline-powered system and the fuel savings it provides is perceived by potential purchasers20. However, potential EV purchasers are not in this category since their cost–benefit analysis is adverse due to the low cost of electricity20. Also, the estimated market shares give a significant share of the market to alternatives that include technology to reduce consumption, due to a more favorable attitude toward environmentally friendly technologies20. Additionally, Shafiei et al. analysed the impact of factors such as fuel prices, vehicle attributes, consumer preferences, and social influences on the market share of EVs. The results showed that the combination of high gasoline prices, decreasing EV prices, dropping tax on EVs and eliminating consumer concerns about recharging has the most significant effect on the market share of EVs21. Kinski et al.22 research shows that the information related to searching on the Internet (Google Trends) for vehicles has a positive and significant relationship with car sales.\n\nBased on the previous research, the following two general conclusions were reached:\n\nFirstly, ML and DL methods have been proven to be effective at predicting vehicle sales. Therefore, LSTM and ConvLSTM, powerful DL models, have been used for predicting vehicle sales in this research. Furthermore, a hybrid model was also proposed, and all three models were compared in terms of performance.\n\nSecondly, factors and features that affect EV sales have been identified, and these features have been collected and used in this research.\n\nMethodology\n\nArtificial Intelligence (AI) refers to the ability of machines to perceive, synthesize, and infer information, as opposed to animals and humans displaying intelligence23. Machine learning, artificial neural networks, and deep learning are important tools in the development of AI systems and have been shown to perform well in predicting time series data such as vehicle sales. Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) are a type of neural network that remember what they have already processed and can learn from previous iterations24. In other words, an RNN is a class of ANNs where connections between nodes form a directed graph along a temporal sequence; this allows it to exhibit temporal dynamic behavior24.\n\nLSTM\n\nHochreiter and Schmidhuber introduced the LSTM network, a RNN capable of learning long-term dependencies and predicting sequential data with great accuracy25. An LSTM is an extension of an RNN, capable of learning patterns from long sequences of source data by retaining a long-term memory25. LSTMs improved the forgetfulness of RNNs. An RNN could retain a memory, but only for its immediate past. An LSTM, on the other hand, introduces loops to generate long-term gradients. While going through its loops, it can discover long-term patterns25. LSTM is good at storing past information and performing well when faced with vanishing gradient issues. During ANN training, each weight of the neural network receives an update proportional to the partial derivative of the error function. Vanishing gradients occur when gradients become vanishingly small, effectively preventing the weight from changing26.\n\nLSTM can tie together three pieces of information at each time step: the current input data, the short-term memory it receives from the previous cell (the hidden state), and the long-term memory from cells farther away (the cell state)27. The LSTM unit consists of an input gate a forget gate, an output gate, and a cell state. The input gate determines how much information should be transferred from the current candidate cell state to the current cell state. The forget gate determines how much historical information should be ignored from the previous cell state. The output flow from cells to the rest of the network can be controlled through the output gate. By regulating the flow of information through the three gates, important information over time intervals can be remembered. According to Eqs. 1–6, the LSTM unit process data in cell state and gates27. Reference27 provides more details.\n\nIn the above equations, \\(f_{t}\\), \\(i_{t}\\), and \\(o_{t}\\) are the forget, input, and output gates, respectively; \\(C_{t}\\), \\(C_{t - 1}\\), and \\(\\tilde{C}_{t}\\) are the current, previous, and candidate cell state; \\(\\sigma\\) and tanh denotes sigmoid and hyperbolic tangent activation functions, respectively; the interconnected weight matrices for each gate and cell state are \\(W_{fh}\\), \\(W_{ih}\\), \\(W_{oh}\\), \\(W_{Ch}\\), respectively; \\(W_{fx}\\), \\(W_{ix}\\), \\(W_{ox}\\), \\(W_{Cx}\\) represent the input weight matrices in the three gates and the cell state, respectively; \\(b_{f}\\), \\(b_{i}\\), \\(b_{o}\\), \\(b_{C}\\) represent the respective bias terms; the Hadamard (element product) product of a matrix is denoted by \\(\\odot\\)27. According to Fig. 1, the input layer is an LSTM layer with the same number of neurons as the input data features. In the next step, one or more LSTM layers are set as the hidden layers, and in the final step, a Dense layer with the ReLU activation function is set as the output layer.\n\nArchitecture of the LSTM model.\n\nConvLSTM\n\nThe LSTM model is powerful for handling temporal correlation. In addition, when working with time series data with numerous features, LSTM model performance can be improved by converting the two-dimensional data to a three-dimensional tensor (Fig. 2 illustrates this), connecting states, and applying convolutional operations; this idea was the reason for creating the ConvLSTM model28. The ConvLSTM neural network is a fully connected LSTM network with a convolutional structure inside the LSTM cell, which does well in predicting data with temporal correlation. ConvLSTM provides a fully connected extension for data transfer between states and from inputs to states28. In other words, ConvLSTM determines the future state of each cell in the grid based on its inputs and neighbours' past states; this can be done by using a convolution operator in the state-to-state and input-to-state transitions28. In the ConvLSTM model, data in the input unit, the outputs of each cell, the hidden units, and the gates are arranged as three-dimensional tensors. ConvLSTM has similar parameters as LSTM, and the difference is in how data is transferred and convolutional multiplication is used in calculations, as expressed in Eqs. 7–1128. Reference28 provides more details.\n\nTransforming 2-D matrix into 3-D tensor.\n\nIn ConvLSTM equations, * indicates the convolution operator, and \\(\\odot\\) indicates the Hadamard product. As shown in Fig. 3, the input layer is a ConvLSTM layer, the hidden layers are Dense and ConvLSTM layers, and the output layer is a Dense layer with the ReLU activation function.\n\nArchitecture of the ConvLSTM model.\n\nHybrid LSTM with two-dimensional attention and residual network\n\nTime series data have a meaningful temporal relationship. In this research, the data were transformed into three-dimensional tensors with a seven-month time window to maintain the temporal relationship; how to transform a two-dimensional matrix to a three-dimensional tensor is shown in Fig. 2. As an innovation, the “Two-Dimensional Attention” method has been proposed in this research to determine the importance of each car's feature in a seven-month time frame and to use the weighted data in the modeling process. The two-dimensional attention method assigns weights to each feature in the time window based on how much it influences the model, allowing the features with a more significant impact to receive more attention and reduce the model's complexity. The one-dimensional attention model was proposed for the first time by Bahdanau to address the problem of the limited access of the decoder to the model's input information when the encoder vector has a fixed length in the translation machine29.\n\nIn the LSTM model architecture, which is shown in Fig. 1, several LSTM layers are placed inside the hidden layer. When the number of LSTM layers in the hidden layer increases, the primary layers (the layers adjacent to the input layer) have a lesser effect on the output. The primary layers have processed the input data and learned the relationship between the data well, which is why it has been tried to improve this problem by using the Residual network in the proposed hybrid model. Using the Residual Network, the weighted data and outputs of the primary layers have been transferred to the final layers in the proposed hybrid model, as shown in Fig. 4.\n\nPrimary architecture of the hybrid model.\n\nIn this study, each input \\(x\\) is represented by an \\(m \\times n\\) matrix, where m corresponds to the previous months in the window (7), and n represents the number of vehicle features. After entering the data into the first LSTM layer, the processing is done according to Eqs. 1–6, and the encoded hidden unit (\\(h\\)) with the exact dimensions (\\(m \\times n\\)) is entered into the Attention layer. After that, the alignment score is calculated according to Eq. (12).\n\nIn Eq. (12), \\(e_{i, j}\\) represents the alignment score, \\(W_{a}\\) is the attention model’s weight (as a trainable variable), \\(h\\) is the encoded hidden unit of the primary LSTM layer, \\(b_{a}\\) is the attention model's bias (as a trainable variable), and the sign \"*\" denotes the Hadamard product. Since the input data for the attention layer has been encoded by an LSTM layer using tanh nonlinear activation function, tanh has also been used in the attention layer to facilitate data reading during decoding. Each input data element was assigned a degree of attention using Eq. (13).\n\nMultiplying attention matrix \\(\\alpha_{i, j}\\) by raw data matrix \\(x_{i, j}\\) yields a weighted data matrix \\(W_{i, j}\\) based on Eq. (14). The sign “*” denotes the Hadamard product.\n\nWeighted data \\(W_{i, j}\\) is then passed through three layers of LSTM as a Residual Network; the output of each layer is combined with the weighted data at the end of the Residual Network and entered into one or more LSTM layers. A Dense layer with the ReLU activation function is the output layer. An overview of the model's architecture is illustrated in Fig. 4.\n\nOther architectures have also been tried in the hybrid model structure, but they were not more efficient, so only the best architecture has been mentioned.\n\nData\n\nIn this study, EVs are considered as vehicles that use electric motors for propulsion and include all types of EVs. In predicting the sale of vehicles, the number of vehicles in the warehouses is an influential factor, which was not used in this modeling due to a lack of access. Since ML models are based on training, in this study, the models can predict the sales of vehicles that have been on the market for at least 24 months. Emerging vehicles (vehicles that have been on the market for less than 24 months) and cars that have not yet entered the market were not included in the modeling due to insufficient data to train the model. Therefore, the share of EVs in the Automotive Market is expressed as a share in vehicle segments and not as a share of EVs overall.\n\nA wide range of information related to car sales has been used in this research. In the primary dataset, all the data is related to new cars, not used cars. The primary dataset contains monthly information about 357 vehicles, such as brand (or \"make\" in auto industry lingo, e.g., Benz), model, segmentation, category, shoppers, and sales of different types of cars in the United States from 2014 to 2020. Other information has been extracted based on the cars in this dataset. The data before the outbreak of Covid-19 disease were used since this disease had adverse impacts on the global economy.\n\nAs stated in previous studies, vehicle specifications are very effective in car sales prediction models. Vehicle specifications are changed annually. According to Alexa rating30 and the comprehensiveness of the information presented on the “Thecarconnection” website31, vehicle specifications were collected through this website. In order to save time and automate the collection of information due to a large number of vehicles and changes in specifications of vehicles over time, several web crawler have been designed and used in Python programming language to collect vehicle information. Several vehicle specifications of the \"CAR-MID/FULL SIZE\" segment are shown in Table 1.\n\nThere is similar information collected for gasoline and EVs; for example, the equivalent MPG in EVs. Price, MPG, max mileage, engine power, and warranty are some of the main features taken into account. Other specifications have been divided into the \"safety specifications\" and the \"other specifications\" categories. The safety specifications category includes child safety rear door locks, airbags, ABS brakes, daytime running lights, night vision, driver monitoring alerts, collision mitigation braking system, electronic stability control, and side impact beams. All other features (traction control, fog lamps, tire pressure monitoring, parking sensors, parking assist, and backup cameras) have been transferred to the other specifications category.\n\nThe second series of collected data refers to user opinions and news published on reputable websites ranked higher on Alexa30. Four websites were examined for this purpose: Autoblog32, Auto News33, Motor134, and The Car Connection35. These websites were crawled using Python web crawlers to save time and collect information automatically. From 2014 to 2020, the daily news published was collected and evaluated for each type of vehicle. The Valence Aware Dictionary and sEntiment Reasoner (VADER) method was used for sentiment analysis of the text. Based on vocabulary analysis, the VADER sentiment analysis method correctly analyzes the sentiment expressed in social media and news texts. Ten independent human raters analyzed over 90,000 ratings in the VADER evaluation, which led to the adoption of 7500 linguistic features that were rated based on their valence scores, which indicate the intensity and polarity of sentiment36. For each vehicle, the average monthly score of news and opinions has been calculated based on their daily publication of them.\n\nAnother effective source of information about the vehicle market is various economic indicators. Using a Python web crawler, information on several economic indicators affecting the car market has been collected on the Federal Reserve website37. Economic indicators include GDP, Consumer Price Index (CPI), Producer Price Index, Consumer Confidence Index, Personal Income Per Capita, Interest Rates on 48-month and 60-month Loans, SP&500, and Dow Jones stock market indicators.\n\nAccording to Kinski's research, using Google trends in prediction models is beneficial and practical22. Three keywords have been selected for Google trend data to evaluate the number of searches for each car from 2014 to 2020 and for the United States of America. The keywords are:\n\n\"Make\" + \"Model\"\n\n\"Price\" + \"Make\" + \"Model\"\n\n\"Dealer\" + \"Make\"\n\nAll cars have the same data collected, and the features collected on a monthly basis for each car are listed in Table 2. Several different trims were available on the market for some vehicles simultaneously, and some characteristics, such as price and MPG, had multiple values for these vehicles. Due to this, the collected values for these characteristics were divided into three categories: minimum, average, and maximum.\n\nThe sales feature has been normalized based on the maximum and minimum values from the training data set. Other features are standardized based on each feature's average and standard deviation in the training set. The input data to models are considered seven-month windows to maintain temporal correlation. For example, in the current month, the last seven months' data are input (X), and the current month's sale is output (Y). In order to achieve this, seven-month data matrices were placed consecutively in the third dimension of a three-dimensional tensor.\n\nValidation and interpretation of results\n\nSince the time series data in this study are monthly, eleven binary columns have been added to the dataset to reflect the effect of each month (in the first month of every year, the column corresponding to the first month is set to 1, and the column for the other months is set to 0). An example of this binary data is shown in Table 3.\n\nFor most vehicles, data includes 79 months (January 2014 through July 2020). According to Fig. 5, the last 14 months are selected for the testing set as rolling cross-validation. Using cross-validation on a rolling basis is one way to validate the time-series model. Starting with a subset of data for training, forecasting for later data points and then checking the accuracy of the forecasts. The same forecasted data points are included in the next training dataset, and further forecasts are made.\n\nSplitting dataset into training, validation, and testing sets.\n\nThe model is cross-validated using 12 forecasting stages, with each stage predicting sales in the next three months. During each prediction stage, the preceding months are divided into training and validation (70% for training and 30% for validation. Then these data are transferred to the model, the model predicts sales in the next three months, then the forecast date is moved forward by one month, and this process has been repeated 12 times. Vehicle sales in the next three months are predicted each time the model runs, assuming most of the vehicle's characteristics remain the same. Due to fluctuation and changes in economic conditions, a three-month time horizon is used for predicting the future.\n\nOverfitting is one of the principal problems in ANN training. The Dropout layers between the neural network layers are one of the best solutions in the ANN to avoid overfitting. During the dropout layer, the number of neurons trained in each layer and those discarded is determined randomly (rather than activating all neurons at once, only a fraction are activated)38. TensorFlow's early stopping tool is another basic solution to avoid overfitting. Early stopping works in the following way: during the repetition of training, the validation data is used to calculate the error value, and whenever the validation error value increases throughout several epochs, the model is ready to be stopped, and overfitting is prevented. For all three models, both solutions are used to prevent overfitting. Dimensionality reduction is another way to prevent model overfitting. In this study, Principal Component Analysis was used in several modes to reduce dimensions, but this technique was not used due to the significant decrease in model performance.\n\nIn order to improve the modeling process, all three models' hyperparameter values and network architectures were determined by Automated Machine Learning (AutoML). AutoML is the process of automating ML applications. The number of hidden layers, the number of neurons in these layers, and the dropout rate was determined by the Tuners. Several values are introduced to the Tuner for each hyperparameter. The Tuner trains different model versions and selects the best one based on the best result (lowest error or loss) on the validation data. This method sets the hyperparameters to the optimal value, and the model is then applied to a test dataset.\n\nThe model's error or loss is calculated using the Mean Absolute Error (MAE) loss function in all three models. Selecting a suitable optimization algorithm for the DL model is essential to reduce the run time and reach the desired result. Adam's optimization algorithm is used for these models, which is a generalized version of stochastic gradient descent. It reduces memory usage, converges faster, and corrects high variance and learning rates39.\n\nComparison of models\n\nWith the validation data, hyperparameters are adjusted, and the model is built to predict vehicle sales over the next three months (three months following the last validation date). The model run-time for all vehicles was very long due to the many vehicle types (357). In a random sample of 15 vehicles, different models' states were compared using fixed data, and the results were compared between the three models.\n\nThe sale of each vehicle is predicted in 12 stages; each prediction stage includes the prediction for the next three months, respectively, the first month of the prediction, the second month of the prediction, and the third month of the prediction. In total, the first predictions include 12 months, the second predictions include 12 months, and the third predictions include 12 months. Model performance was evaluated using the Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE), the Root Mean Square Error normalized by the change range (\\(NRSME_{range}\\)), and the Root Mean Square Error normalized by the mean value (\\(NRSME_{mean}\\)) according to Eqs. 15–18.\n\nAccording to the above equations, \\(y_{t}\\) denotes the actual value at time t, \\(\\hat{y}_{t}\\) denotes the predicted value at time t, \\(y_{max}\\) denotes the maximum actual value, \\(y_{min}\\) denotes the minimum actual value, \\(y_{mean}\\) denotes the average actual value, and T is equal to the total number of predicted samples. The average error values of all vehicles were calculated to compare the results of various models. A weighted average was calculated using the total number of sales of each car per month as a weight for the vehicle according to Eq. (19) since the numbers of vehicle sales are not on the same scale, and the error rate is more important in vehicles with high sales. A further method of checking the models' performance is to compare the R-square, slope, and intercept of the linear regressions fitted on predicted and observed data for all three models. Table 4 summarizes the evaluation results of the models.\n\nIn the proposed hybrid model, the error values are lower, the R-square accuracy is higher, the slope value is closer to 1, and the intercept is closer to 0. At this stage, the proposed hybrid model was recognized as preferable to both the LSTM and ConvLSTM models.\n\nImplementation of the proposed hybrid model to predict the share of EVs\n\nFor all vehicles, the proposed hybrid model has been implemented, and 12 points of prediction have been used to determine the sale of all vehicles. Linear regression was fitted on the predicted sales and actual values to evaluate the model's performance, as shown in Table 5.\n\nPrimary data segments vehicles by specifications according to segments like CAR-SMALL_COMPACT, CAR-MID_FULL SIZE, MINIVAN LARGE, and PICKUP LARGE. Each segment consists of similar vehicles in appearance and specifications that compete with one another. Segments that include EVs have been separated to determine the share of EVs. Based on actual and predicted sales, the shares of electric and gasoline vehicles have been compared and evaluated for each month of the test data. For example, the CAR-MID/FULL-SIZE segment includes 28 vehicles (23 gasoline vehicles and five EVs). Figure 6 shows the share of EVs in this segment based on twelve prediction stages (three months per stage), separately for the first, second, and third months of each prediction.\n\n(a) Share of EVs in CAR-MID/FULL-SIZE based on the first month of each prediction. (b). Share of EVs in CAR-MID/FULL-SIZE based on the second month of each prediction. (c) Share of EVs in CAR-MID/FULL-SIZE based on the third month of each prediction.\n\nAll segments' MAEs for EVs' share forecasting in the forecast's first, second, and third months are shown in Table 6. The average MAE value of all segments was calculated as 3.2% for the first months, 3.8% for the second months, and 3.5% for the third months. The average value for all segments and all forecast months was calculated at about 3.5%, which shows that the proposed hybrid model performed well.\n\nAs part of the model analysis, the segments that included EVs were separated again and ranked by sales within each segment. The rankings were based on actual sales (actual rank) and predicted sales (predicted rank); the actual rank and predicted rank were used for evaluation. Kendall-Tau correlation (Kendall's correlation) is commonly used to check the concordance of two ranked lists; this technique was used to examine the actual and predicted rankings in this study. Kendall's correlation rate for two rating lists \\(r_{a}\\) and \\(r_{b}\\) (\\(\\tau_{{r_{a} , r_{b} }}\\)) is represented by Eq. (20) 40.\n\nIn Eq. (20), \\(n_{c}\\) represents the number of concordant pairs, \\(n_{d}\\) represents the number of discordant pairs, and n represents the total number of ranks in each of the rating lists40. The maximum number of discordant pairs between two ranking lists equals \\(\\frac{1}{2} n\\left( {n - 1} \\right)\\), and Kendall's correlation equals + 1 if all pairs of ranks are concordant and -1 if none are concordant 40. For all segments, Kendall's correlation values were calculated separately for the first, second, and third prediction months, and the average values are shown in Table 7. The average Kendall's correlation value of all segments was calculated as 0.76 for the first months, 0.742 for the second months, and 0.75 for the third months. The average Kendall's correlation value for all segments and all forecast months was calculated at about 0.75, which indicates the great performance of the proposed hybrid model in predicting the ranking.\n\nSensitivity analysis\n\nSensitivity analysis was performed to determine which features significantly impacted the trained model. Thus, for each vehicle, the pre-trained model that was evaluated in previous stages has once again predicted the number of vehicle sales with new input data, and its outputs have been assessed. All features, except the investigated feature, are valued at their average. For the investigated feature, the five values from the training data (the min value, the first quartile, the second quartile, the third quartile, and the max value) are taken into consideration. Five predictions were made based on these five values, and a range of changes in predicted sales was calculated. The change ranges for all features have been measured, and the four features with the most extensive range have been identified. As an example, during the sensitivity analysis of the BMW I3 for 2020, the following four features had the broadest range of changes: the Consumer Price Index (CPI), the equivalent MPG for EVs, the Google search score for car prices (Google Trends), and the car price. This EV's sensitivity analysis plots are shown in Fig. 7.\n\n(a) Sensitivity analysis plot of influential feature 1 for BMW I3. (b) Sensitivity analysis plot of influential feature 2 for BMW I3. (c) Sensitivity analysis plot of influential feature 3 for BMW I3. (d) Sensitivity analysis plot of influential feature 4 for BMW I3.\n\nBased on Eq. (21), slope values for the four characteristics with the most extensive range of changes are calculated in different parts of the graph, and the results are summarized in Table 8. For example, the number of sales of this EV has decreased by 8 for every thousand-dollar increase in price when the price is in the range of the minimum value to the first quarter. As the slope is zero percent in the second and third parts of the graph, the price in the first, second, and third quartiles is equal, and when the price is in the third quartile to the maximum price, the number of sales for this EV decrease by 6 for every thousand-dollar increase in price.\n\nThere has been a decrease in car sales due to the increase in the CPI. It is also true that with the increase in the CPI, the final price of the car and the price of auto parts have increased, which has led to a decrease in the desire to buy this car. The second feature is equivalent MPG for EVs, a higher equivalent MPG indicating better performance and less fuel consumption in a fixed distance has led to an increase in sales of this car. The third feature identified is the increase in the car price search score on Google (Google Trend), an indicator that buyers are more curious about this car, contributing to its sales. The fourth specified feature of the car is its price, and its sales have decreased with the increase in its price. As a result of the sensitivity analysis, the manufacturers of this car could use policies such as lowering the price of the car and its parts (CPI and car price), improving the performance of the vehicle's engine (the equivalent MPG), and developing advertisements and introducing the car to the public (Google trend score) to increase sales.\n\nSensitivity analysis has been conducted for each EV, and the results show different sensitivity for each vehicle. From each segment that includes EVs, one vehicle was selected as a sample, and the results of its sensitivity analysis are shown in Table 9.\n\nEach EV's sensitivity analysis identifies features that differ from the others, as shown in Table 9. According to the results of the sensitivity analysis, ten features that were most frequently found in the sensitivity analysis of all the EVs were identified as the most influential features: Shoppers, Min price, CPI, Sales, Google Trends score 3 (Price), Make & model news score, Personal income per capita, Make news score, Interest Rates on 60-month, and Mean options score, respectively.\n\nConclusion\n\nThis study addresses an important topic from a business perspective. Car manufacturers can benefit from this research by understanding their market share and the effect of pricing and vehicle specification on the market share. They can use the results of this study to analyze both their EV market as well as their Non-EV market. Lower down the funnel, car dealers that operate in a highly competitive environment can strategize their sales events, marketing campaigns, and discounts to meet their business goals and target sales. Finally, the model enables the public sector to understand the effect of tax policies on the share of EV vehicles in case they like to promote them.\n\nThis study used ML methods to develop a prediction model that estimated the sale of all cars in the dataset, the share of EVs in each segment and identified the main factors affecting each EV's sales. In this research, several web crawlers have been used to collect various data, including factors that previous studies have proven to be associated with EV sales. Vehicles sale were predicted using LSTM, ConvLSTM, and the proposed hybrid model (Hybrid LSTM with two-dimensional Attention and Residual network). Several ML tools have been used to improve the model's training and the modeling process, such as transforming two-dimensional time series data into three-dimensional tensors, Dropout layers, early stopping tools, and AutoML. Because of the variety of car types and the long running time of the models, a random selection of fifteen types of cars was made. All three models are evaluated based on the same evaluation units: the MAPE, NRSME_range, and NRSME_mean, R-square, slope, and intercept of fitted linear regressions have also been assessed. The average error values in the three months of prediction were as follows:\n\nThe MAPE value of the proposed hybrid model was 4.5% less than the LSTM model and 14.4% less than the ConvLSTM model.\n\nThe NRSME_range value of the hybrid model was 0.11 less than the LSTM model and 0.22 less than the ConvLSTM model.\n\nThe NRSME_mean value of the hybrid model was 0.079 less than the LSTM model and 0.169 less than the ConvLSTM model.\n\nAs a result of fitting linear regressions to the predicted and actual values, for all three months of predictions, the proposed hybrid model has a higher R-square value, its slope is closer to one, and its intercept is closer to zero, which indicates that the hybrid model performed better than the other two. In comparing the models, it was found that the proposed hybrid model conducted better than other models and was selected to predict the sale of all vehicles in the dataset. Based on the linear regression fitted to the predicted sales and the actual sales of all vehicles, the R-square values for the first, second and third prediction months were 0.912, 0.906, and 0.917.\n\nThe predicted sales of all vehicles were used to calculate the predicted share of EVs in each segment and compare them with the actual values. Across all segments and forecasting months, the average MAE value for EV share is about 3.5%, and the hybrid model has accurately predicted the share of EVs across all segments. To further analyze the model results, the cars were ranked according to the number of actual and predicted sales within each segment. The average Kendall's correlation value for all segments and all forecast months was calculated at about 0.75, which indicates the high performance of the proposed hybrid model in predicting the ranking.\n\nThe sensitivity analysis was performed to evaluate the model further and identify its most influential features. The results have shown that each EV's sensitivity analysis identifies features that differ from the others. According to the sensitivity analysis of the BMW I3 for 2020, the following four features were most affected: the Consumer Price Index, the equivalent MPG for EVs, the Google search score, and the car price. As a result of the sensitivity analysis, the manufacturers of this car could use policies such as lowering the price of the car and its parts, improving the engine's performance, developing advertisements, and better introducing the car to increase sales (See Appendix Tables A1 to A4.2, Fig. A1).\n\nThis research has achieved the following accomplishments:\n\nA wide variety of factors have been collected and used as variables to model the sale of EVs.\n\nLSTM and ConvLSTM, powerful DL models, have been used for predicting vehicle sales. By combining the two-dimensional Attention model and the Residual network, the performance of the LSTM model was enhanced, and the innovative hybrid model performed better than the other two.\n\nEVs differ in terms of the most influential factors for sales depending on the sensitivity analysis results. The ten features that appeared the most in the sensitivity analysis of all EVs were identified as the most influential, including Shoppers, Min price, CPI, Sales, Google Trends score 3 (Price), News score for make and model, Personal income per capita, News score for make, Interest Rates on 60-month, and Mean options score, respectively.\n\nData availability\n\nThe primary dataset was taken from Autometrics, and other data were collected using web crawlers.

        "Machine learning models employed in charging infrastructure optimization": "Optimizing EV Charging Infrastructure: A Data-Driven Approach to ... : \nOptimizing EV Charging Infrastructure: A Data-Driven Approach to Predicting Power Demand and Analyzing Geographic Disparities\n\nThis paper presents a data-driven approach to optimizing electric vehicle (EV) charging infrastructure using a stacked ensemble learning model, which predicts power demand (kWh) per session to address challenges like long wait times, geographic disparities, and uneven resource allocation. Leveraging data from 85 EV drivers across 105 charging stations, the study identifies critical factors influencing station performance, such as session duration, time of day, and regional demand. Extensive preprocessing steps, including cyclical encoding of time-related variables, one-hot encoding of categorical features, and standardization of numerical variables, ensured the dataset was properly prepared for machine learning analysis. The stacked ensemble model combines Random Forest, XGBoost, and Neural Network models, effectively capturing both linear and non-linear relationships in the data. The results highlight significant urban-rural disparities in charging infrastructure. Urban stations exhibit higher and more consistent demand, whereas rural areas show sporadic and limited usage, underscoring the need for targeted infrastructure investment in underserved regions. Temporal patterns further reveal peak charging demand during business hours at workplace stations, emphasizing the potential for dynamic optimization of station placement and operational capacity based on usage trends. The model achieved a low Mean Squared Error (MSE) on training data (0.1577 kWh), but a higher MSE on test data (1.7875 kWh) indicates overfitting, suggesting the need for further refinement. Despite this limitation, the model offers valuable insights into optimizing EV charging networks, enabling policymakers and developers to improve infrastructure planning and reduce geographic inequities. Future work will focus on expanding the dataset to include residential and public charging scenarios, incorporating additional variables like weather and traffic patterns, and refining model architecture to improve generalization. This study contributes to building equitable and efficient EV charging networks, supporting the growing adoption of sustainable transportation.\n\nThis is an Open Access article, distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/), which permits unrestricted use, distribution and reproduction in any medium or format, provided the original work is properly cited.\n\nCopyright © The Author(s), 2024.

To contribute to this problem solving, a multi-objective framework for EV demands response in power systems, optimizing charging and discharging schedules while considering maximum load-handling capacity and EV users’ state of charge (SoC) satisfaction as constraints are proposed. The framework employs a vehicle-to-grid (V2G) approach to achieve these goals. The proposed model, centered on aggregators and EV users, tackles issues such as power loss reduction, voltage profile enhancement, and optimal EV charging and discharging scheduling to maximize system performance. For this aim, we address this problem as a multi-objective optimization one using a linear weighted sum technique to simultaneously address the framework objectives. To tackle the optimization problem, a metaheuristic swarm intelligence algorithm, the Red Deer Algorithm (RDA), is utilized to determine the optimal EV charging and discharging timings. The efficiency of the proposed method on a IEEE 69-bus system is tested. The experiment simulates residential EV loads using two sets of different EVs; The first set included Tata Nexon, BYD Seal and Hyundai Ioniq and the second set included Nissan Leaf e+, MG ZS EV Long Range and Mercedes EQS AMG 53 4MATIC+. These vehicles, with different charging powers, are connected to the network via load or generator buses based on household demands. The aim was to determine the optimal power flow for charging and analyze the impact of EV integration during peak and off-peak hours. Simulation results demonstrated that the EV schedule management method significantly reduces average EV load demand without overloading the distribution network’s power flow, while maintaining an improved voltage profile. Furthermore, by integrating drone technology, EVs can transmit stored information back to the grid, enhancing the overall energy management beyond power consumption.\n\nSimilar content being viewed by others\n\nA multi-objective optimization framework for EV-integrated distribution grids using the hiking optimization algorithm\n\nOptimal scheduling of solar powered EV charging stations in a radial distribution system using opposition-based competitive swarm optimization\n\nA TOPSIS based multi-objective optimal deployment of solar PV and BESS units in power distribution system electric vehicles load demand\n\nIntroduction\n\nAmid the ongoing energy crisis and increasing environmental concerns caused by classical fossil fuel energy sources, optimizing renewable energy utilization has become a critical area of research and innovation, engaging engineers, policymakers, and industry practitioners. Distributed generation (DG), particularly from renewable sources, plays a pivotal role in enhancing efficiency and promoting environmentally sustainable electricity production. However, integrating renewable distributed generation into power systems introduces operational complexities due to the inherent variability and intermittency of these sources. To address these challenges, demand response (DR) has emerged as a key mechanism to enhance grid reliability, offering greater flexibility and maintaining a balanced supply-demand relationship.\n\nThe significance of DR in power system operations has been extensively studied from multiple perspectives. As examples, one study evaluated DR programs as a viable alternative to conventional generation methods, particularly in wind-integrated systems, analyzing the effectiveness of tariff-based and incentive-based strategies in optimizing grid stability and economic efficiency1. Another research highlighted DR’s crucial role in improving power system reliability during extreme weather events, emphasizing the importance of well-structured market mechanisms to maximize its potential2. Additionally, an innovative agent-based framework was proposed to enhance demand-side flexibility, where a central demand response provider (DRP) efficiently coordinates industrial and residential aggregators, enabling optimal load management and improved energy efficiency3.\n\nElectric vehicles (EVs) significantly contribute to carbon dioxide (CO₂) reduction and grid management through demand response (DR) programs. Their integration into Vehicle-to-Grid (V2G) systems enables efficient energy transfer, but their limited battery capacity necessitates aggregator involvement for effective participation4. In addition, aggregators facilitate energy flow management and market participation, optimizing prices and increasing revenue for EV owners. However, technological barriers, such as the need for advanced bidirectional charging systems, and regulatory challenges require policy updates to support V2G interactions5. Future advancements in battery technology and increased public awareness are crucial for widespread adoption. Addressing infrastructure and regulatory issues will be key to maximizing EV benefits in DR programs.\n\nAggregators play a vital role in enabling electric vehicle (EV) users to participate in the energy market, but they are facing challenges due to the unpredictable charging behavior of EV owners, which affects grid stability and market efficiency6. Technical issues, such as uncontrolled charging leading to power quality concerns, necessitate smart solutions like Vehicle-to-Grid (V2G) technology. In energy markets, aggregators must balance efficiency and fairness in resource allocation7. Despite these challenges, coordinated strategies can enhance grid stability, optimize costs, and improve renewable energy integration. Engaging prosumers may further strengthen flexibility and resilience in the energy system, highlighting the potential of aggregators to drive market efficiency and system reliability8.\n\nOperating as private entities, aggregators consistently aim to maximize their profits through various strategies. These may include offering additional services9 and participating in secondary reserve markets within the electrical system. The complex interplay between aggregator objectives, EV user needs, and grid requirements underscores the importance of optimized management strategies in this evolving landscape. Collaborative efforts among multiple aggregators have the potential to enhance DR flexibility and improve service quality for customers, even with relatively simple infrastructure configurations at each station. For instance, a centralized hierarchical framework where the Distribution System Operator (DSO) coordinates charging across all aggregators to minimize energy purchase costs under Time-of-Use (TOU) tariffs and achieve peak load control is proposed. This approach may facilitate cooperation between multiple aggregators and distribution operators. However, this approach may also raise concerns regarding data privacy and personal financial security.\n\nCoordinating EV aggregators without a central controller relies on distributed optimization algorithms and incentive-based mechanisms to enhance system efficiency. Neurodynamic-based algorithms can optimize real-time bidding strategies7, while alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) enables collaborative optimization between network operators and aggregators10. Incentive models like Nash Bargaining Theory promote fair trading7, and Peer-to-Peer Trading reduces costs and risks11. Overcoming challenges in fairness and distributed energy management is key to sustainable EV grid integration.\n\nThis paper comprehensively examines and quantifies the benefits for the above cited three stakeholders. For this purpose, we propose an enhanced model of EV user satisfaction that accounts for the nonlinear relationship between changes in the EV State of Charge (SoC) and user satisfaction with aggregator services. Based on this analysis, we suggest an optimal scheduling algorithm for aggregator operations. This algorithm enables aggregators to maximize their profits while meeting the minimum DR capability standards set by the distribution network and satisfying EV user requirements.\n\nThis study focuses on residential aggregators, emphasizing service quality, DR performance, and the time-space statistics of EV behaviors. This focus is motivated by the limited range of EV batteries and the correlation of charging and discharging behaviors across different stations. The interrelation between EV user service requests, the profit of multiple aggregators, and their economic incentives for DR program participation is explored, considering the stringent charging requirements of EV consumers.\n\nThis research introduces a multi-objective optimization framework that integrates grid constraints, time-of-use (TOU) pricing structures, and consumer satisfaction while optimizing EV charging and discharging schedules. Unlike conventional methods, this framework dynamically manages the unpredictability of EV charging behaviors while ensuring flexibility in real-time energy demand response. A key advantage of this approach is its ability to assess the impact of TOU pricing under varying demand scenarios, effectively balancing peak and off-peak load variations. Moreover, State of Charge (SoC) constraints are incorporated to adaptively accommodate fluctuating EV charging requirements. Distinct from conventional algorithms such as Genetic Algorithms (GA) and Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), this study employs a Red Deer Algorithm (RDA)-based optimization framework to jointly optimize EV charging/discharging schedules, grid balancing, and energy demand forecasting. By integrating V2G capabilities, the proposed approach enables EVs to supply energy back into the grid, enhancing overall grid stability and energy flow management. Additionally, the innovative incorporation of drones for real-time data exchange between EVs and the grid may further improve communication efficiency, allowing for better energy allocation and charging station utilization.\n\nThe proposed optimization framework effectively addresses scalability challenges in large-scale test cases involving thousands of variables. Utilizing the Red Deer Algorithm (RDA), a metaheuristic approach balancing exploration and exploitation within the optimization problem search-space, the method ensures efficient scheduling of EV charging and discharging while maintaining grid stability. The IEEE 69-bus test system, with a diverse fleet of EVs, was used to validate the framework, demonstrating its capability to optimize power flow without overloading the grid. The multi-objective optimization approach, incorporating a linear weighted sum technique, efficiently handles constraints such as State of Charge (SoC), load demand variations, and peak/off-peak energy pricing. Compared to traditional algorithms, RDA reduces computational complexity through hierarchical population structuring and intelligent local search mechanisms. Empirical validation with over 1000 households confirmed the approach’s effectiveness in minimizing peak load impact while dynamically adapting to grid constraints. Additionally, real-time drone-assisted data exchange may contribute in enhancing decision-making accuracy in distributed environments, making the method robust for large-scale applications.\n\nThe remainder of this paper is structured as follows: Sect. \"Literature review\" presents a comprehensive literature review, divided into six subsections covering key aspects such as the role of aggregators in EV energy management, optimization techniques for EV aggregation, stakeholder considerations, advanced control and machine learning techniques, microgrid stability enhancement through V2G integration, and identified research gaps.

The adoption of DERs, including solar, wind energy, and electric vehicles (EVs), offers numerous benefits, such as reducing greenhouse gas emissions, improving energy flexibility, and enhancing system resilience and reliability12. Among DERs, EVs are rapidly gaining importance due to their potential for bidirectional energy exchange with the grid. Aggregators play a crucial role in managing EV operations, including charging, discharging, and optimizing their interactions with the grid13. In what follows, the components of the DERs within the framework of EVs charging-discharging and the bidirectional transfer of energy between several parties will be explicited. The main focus will be on the role of the aggregators in managing the transfer of energy as well the impact of swarm and artificial intelligence optimization techniques in providing the optimal schedules of the whole system operation. In addition, the integration of V2G energy transfer mode aiming to ensure more stability of the microgrid will be surveyed based on sevral previous studies on the topic. Note here that this section aims to critically investigate recent literature review in order to well-situate the contributions of our paper as compared to previous studies. This litertaure review will end by providing a comprehensive summary of the findings of selected studies while emphasising on the novelties of our study.\n\nRole of aggregators in EV energy management\n\nAggregators act as intermediaries between EV users and the energy market, facilitating optimal energy dispatch strategies. According to research published in the European Platform of Legal Frameworks14, EV aggregation networks enable market participation by connecting individual EV owners with central energy providers. This role is essential in mitigating the unpredictable nature of EV charging patterns, improving grid stability, and ensuring efficient energy utilization15. However, existing literature lacks a unified strategy for optimizing EV aggregator participation in energy markets under uncertainty, highlighting the need for improved decision-making frameworks.\n\nOptimization techniques for EV aggregation\n\nSeveral optimization strategies have been proposed to enhance EV aggregation decision-making under uncertainty. These methodologies can be broadly classified into stochastic and deterministic approaches.\n\nStochastic Optimization: Stochastic methods consider uncertainties in EV availability and charging behavior by modeling multiple probable outcomes. Scenario-based techniques estimate power requirements by evaluating various scenarios16. However, these methods require a high computational burden due to the extensive number of trials necessary to assess large-scale EV fleets17.\n\nDeterministic Approaches: Deterministic models predict energy consumption and available charging times for individual EVs, assuming known driving patterns. While these models offer precise decision-making, they often fail to account for real-world uncertainties18. Some studies introduce risk-averse techniques, such as chance constraints19 or conditional value-at-risk methods20, to enhance robustness. However, these approaches often lack adaptability to worst-case scenarios, such as extreme fluctuations in EV participation21.\n\nTo mitigate computational challenges, researchers have developed scenario-reduction techniques that balance complexity and solution optimality. These methods streamline calculations by prioritizing key scenarios without significantly compromising accuracy22.\n\nConsideration of stakeholders in EV optimization\n\nTo further improve energy management, recent studies integrate the perspectives of multiple stakeholders, including EV owners, aggregators, and distribution system operators (DSOs). For instance, the research in23 proposes a multi-objective framework that balances cost minimization for EV owners while reducing power losses and enhancing system efficiency for DSOs. By applying this methodology to an IEEE 69-bus test feeder with real-world load data, the study demonstrates its effectiveness in optimizing charging schedules and minimizing operational expenses.\n\nAdvanced control and machine learning techniques in energy management\n\nBeyond traditional optimization techniques, recent advancements integrate artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) to enhance decision-making in energy management systems:\n\nFuzzy cloud stochastic models optimize energy distribution and storage efficiency by considering multi-objective constraints, such as emissions and cost reduction24.\n\nIntelligent Energy Management Systems (EMS) segment daily energy demand into smaller intervals, reducing voltage fluctuations and network losses25.\n\nFuzzy logic-based EV selection models prioritize cost-efficiency while minimizing battery degradation, ensuring long-term sustainability26.\n\nMachine learning algorithms, including Gaussian Process modeling and Krill Herd Algorithm, provide accurate predictions of HEV charging demand, reducing prediction errors and operational costs27.\n\nHybrid control strategies such as Fuzzy PID controllers, Grey Wolf Optimization, and Random Forest techniques dynamically adjust EV charging schedules, optimizing efficiency in uncertain environments28,29,30.\n\nEnhancing microgrid stability through V2G integration\n\nThe integration of vehicle-to-grid (V2G) technology strengthens microgrid stability by enabling EVs to function as distributed energy reserves. V2G strategies improve grid efficiency by reducing congestion and balancing supply-demand dynamics in real time31. Stochastic optimization approaches, including Coati Optimization and Iterative Map-Based Self-Adaptive Crystal Structure Algorithm, have demonstrated effectiveness in managing unpredictable EV charging behaviors32. Additionally, ML-based predictive models further refine energy distribution strategies, ensuring optimized grid performance33.\n\nIdentified research gaps and contribution of the proposed study\n\nDespite significant advancements in EV aggregation and energy management strategies, several gaps remain:\n\nComputational Scalability and Robustness: Existing stochastic and deterministic optimization techniques struggle with handling large-scale networks and managing the uncertainties of EV behaviors efficiently.\n\nLack of Integrated AI-Based Methods: Limited integration of AI-based techniques with conventional energy management frameworks for real-time decision-making.\n\nStakeholder-Specific Multi-Objective Frameworks: Current studies lack a comprehensive framework that simultaneously considers aggregator profitability, EV user satisfaction, and grid stability.\n\nV2G and Drone-Assisted Data Exchange: The absence of an integrated approach combining V2G capabilities with aggregator-based optimization for enhanced grid stability, particularly using drone-assisted real-time data exchange.\n\nThe State-of-the-Art Comparison Table 1 provides a structured overview of various optimization methodologies used for EV energy management, comparing their key findings and limitations. It highlights advancements in AI-based, stochastic, and hybrid optimization techniques for grid stability, cost efficiency, and energy management. The reviewed studies demonstrate the effectiveness of various optimization techniques but also reveal critical gaps, particularly in addressing scalability, real-time adaptability, and the integration of emerging technologies. Building on these insights, the next section formulates the optimization problem, outlining the objectives and constraints that guide the proposed framework.\n\nProblem formulation\n\nEVs, equipped with vehicle-to-grid (V2G) technology, have the potential to consume and send energy back to the grid. This bidirectional capability, coupled with aggregator models and unmanned aerial systems (UASs) commonly known as drones serving as enablers for the EV charging efficient operation, can revolutionize energy management, grid stability, and remote monitoring. Furthermore, drone-based sensors and communication tools facilitate real-time data collection and monitoring, especially in remote areas where traditional infrastructure is limited. In fact, drones may play a key role in centralizing the data collected from various stakeholders including the EVs, charging stations, grid operators among others. In addition, they may provide the EVs drivers (or the autonomous EVs) with information about the crowd particularly when they are moving toward the optimal available charging stations. Under these conditions, the gain in term of driving time, battery autonomy, grid stability and charging stations management is ensured.\n\nIn the context of smart grids, Vehicle-to-Grid (V2G) technology plays a crucial role in enhancing grid flexibility, stability, and efficiency. V2G enables bidirectional energy exchange between electric vehicles (EVs) and the power grid, allowing EVs not only to consume electricity but also to supply energy back to the grid when needed. This interaction facilitates several benefits, including load balancing, active and reactive power compensation, and demand-side management. One of the key advantages of V2G is its ability to store excess renewable energy, particularly from intermittent sources like solar and wind, within EV batteries. This stored energy can then be dispatched back to the grid during peak demand periods, improving grid reliability and energy utilization. V2G systems can be categorized into unidirectional (V1G) and bidirectional configurations. Unidirectional V2G supports controlled charging to optimize grid stability, while bidirectional V2G, as employed in our proposed method, allows EVs to function as distributed energy storage units that actively contribute to grid support.\n\nIn our approach, EVs dynamically exchange energy with the grid, assisting in peak load management and renewable energy integration. By enabling EVs to discharge surplus energy during high-demand periods and recharge during low-demand hours, the proposed V2G framework enhances grid resilience, reduces operational costs, and minimizes reliance on conventional power plants. Furthermore, V2G empowers EV owners to participate in demand response programs, providing financial incentives while optimizing grid performance. This strategic energy exchange fosters a more sustainable and intelligent energy ecosystem, supporting the transition toward greener and more efficient power networks.\n\nThe generalization of the V2G architecture is illustrated in Fig. 1. EV charging stations (EVCSs) are engaged in supervising each EV charging point and organize them so that, when aggregated, they possess sufficient generating capacity to significantly impact the power network. The primary role of the EVCS monitoring system is to report on the EVs parked in the respective area by collecting data such as EV’s time of arrival, departure time, the initial SoC, the final SoC etc. to the aggregator in predefined timeframes. This centralized management approach using EVCS enables effective monitoring of a large-scale EV fleet, contributing to load management and grid stability23.\n\nAn EV aggregated by an agent like an aggregator becomes a potential resource to engage in the DR programs, thus the need for an optimization algorithm to handle EV scheduling for better operational stability, improved provision of service and customer satisfaction.\n\nBy aggregating EVs, an aggregator can effectively participate in DR programs, enhancing grid stability and service quality. Optimizing EV charging and discharging schedules through appropriate algorithms is crucial to maximize the benefits for both EV owners and the power grid.\n\nEVCS aggregation scheme with drone-enabled V2G system.\n\nThe residential distribution systems consider the role of an aggregator who plans the optimal EV charging schedule to maximize the cost-benefit ratio. An agreement of fixed monthly fee might be established between the aggregator and the EV owners34. EV owners benefit from lower charging costs made easy by the aggregators. The effectiveness of the distribution mechanism does not affect the aggregator. To optimize charging, the aggregator requires information about the vehicle’s starting SoC, arrival time, and departure time. The results of unplanned operation are compared with those of scheduled charging and discharge35.\n\nOptimal scheduling of EV charging/discharging\n\nThe objective of optimal EV scheduling is to balance the interests of the aggregator and the DSO36. To simplify the investigation, we assume that EVs maintain a constant charging/discharging power equal to their rated capacity throughout each time slot. At the beginning of each time slot, an optimization algorithm is employed to determine the optimal schedule. In this work, the scheduling strategy is evaluated using three EV models with different rated values for a 10-minute time slot37. The optimal scheduling scheme for a time slot ‘t’ is formulated (Eq. 1) from the EV aggregator perspective.\n\nwhere,\n\n\\(\\:{P}_{\\text{m}\\text{a}\\text{x}}\\) maximum charging/discharging power in kW\n\n\\(\\:{\\rho\\:}_{t}\\) charge/discharge rate,\n\n\\(\\:C\\left(t\\right)\\) is the electricity price at time instant ‘t’,\n\n\\(\\:\\left\\{\\text{0,1},-1\\right\\}\\) denotes the idle state, discharging and charging of the EV, respectively.\n\nEnergy available in the battery E(tn) is given by:\n\n\\(\\:E\\left({t}_{0}\\right)\\:\\)is the initial energy of the battery, while the SoC at the \\(\\:{t}_{0}\\) instant is computed as,\n\n\\(\\:SoC\\left({t}_{0}\\right)\\): The State of Charge at time \\(\\:{t}_{0}\\), representing the remaining energy in the battery as a fraction of its maximum capacity.\n\n\\(\\:So{C}_{\\text{m}\\text{a}\\text{x}}\\): The maximum possible \\(\\:SoC\\) (100% or 1.0 in normalized form).\n\n\\(\\:{W}_{\\text{k}}\\): The energy consumed by vehicles for traveling k kilometers.\n\nd: The distance traveled (in kilometers) during the given trip.\n\nk: A normalization factor for distance, representing trip characteristics.\n\n\\(\\:{E}_{\\text{m}\\text{a}\\text{x}}\\): The maximum energy storage capacity of the EV’s battery.\n\nFor simulation purposes, let’s assume the initial energy of the SoC to be 25% of the total rated battery capacity.\n\nThe SoC at the nth instant is given by,\n\nThe duration between \\(\\:{t}_{0}\\) and T is utilized for the scheduling process.\n\nFrom a DSO perspective, the responsibility lies in making sure all network limits are met. To run the network effectively, the goal is to reduce power loss. Thus, the line loss \\(\\:{P}_{Loss,t}\\) of the distribution system at time instant ‘t’ can be expressed as,\n\nsubject to,\n\nWhere,\n\n\\(\\:{P}_{G,t}\\) real power generation at the slack bus at time instant ‘t’\n\n\\(\\:{P}_{{D}_{i,t}}\\) real power load at the ith bus at time instant ‘t’.\n\nWhile, \\(\\:{P}_{{D}_{{k}_{\\text{new\\:}}},t}\\) is the current real power load at kth bus, including the real power demand PDk,t and the charging/discharging EV power at time ‘t’ as represented by Eq. (9)\n\nWhere, \\(\\:{V}_{n}\\) denotes the voltage magnitude at the nth bus. \\(\\:{V}_{\\text{m}\\text{i}\\text{n}}\\) and \\(\\:{V}_{\\text{m}\\text{a}\\text{x}}\\) are the minimum and maximum voltage limits, respectively.\n\nThe aggregator and DSO coordinate their efforts to implement optimal scheduling, ensuring efficient grid operation. This strategy satisfies all the demands and limitations put forth by the aggregator and DSO while minimizing the charging costs faced by EV owners and the power loss in the network38.\n\nConsidering the previous analysis, the final objective function is expressed as a weighted sum of Eq. (1) and Eq. (7) as follows,\n\nWhere \\(\\:{w}_{1}\\) and \\(\\:{w}_{2}\\) are weight factors.\n\nThe linear weighted sum technique was selected for EV scheduling optimization due to its simplicity, flexibility, and practical applicability. It effectively combines multiple conflicting objectives, such as minimizing power losses, improving voltage profiles, and ensuring EV user satisfaction, into a single function by assigning adjustable weights. This method is computationally efficient, avoiding the complexity of maintaining Pareto-optimal solutions, and is well-suited for large-scale problems. Its adaptability allows dynamic weight adjustments to accommodate varying operational conditions, ensuring robustness across diverse scenarios. Comparative analysis confirms its balance of simplicity and performance, making it ideal for the proposed EV scheduling framework.\n\nMeasure of user satisfaction with EV’s SoC\n\nSoC satisfaction measures the extent to which an aggregator can fulfill the charging/discharging needs of an EV user. When EV users participate in the service, facility constraints or operational limitations may lead to discrepancies between predicted and actual charging/discharging SoC, potentially affecting customer satisfaction. To quantify this, we introduce an index, denoted as \\(\\:{G}_{1,i}\\text{\\%}\\), representing the satisfaction of the ith EV with its SoC upon leaving the aggregator34.\n\nwhere \\(\\:SO{C}_{0,i}\\) – arrival time SoC\n\n\\(\\:SO{C}_{i}^{{\\prime\\:}}\\)- targeted SoC value\n\n\\(\\:SO{C}_{i}^{{\\prime\\:}{\\prime\\:}}\\)- SoC value at the ith EV departure time.\n\nWith the problem clearly defined and the key constraints identified, an efficient optimization approach is required to achieve multi-objective scheduling while ensuring grid stability. The following section introduces the Red Deer Algorithm (RDA), detailing its mechanism and its suitability for solving the formulated optimization problem.\n\nRed deer algorithm (RDA)\n\nThe Red Deer Algorithm (RDA)39 is a nature-inspired optimization technique that draws its inspiration from the unique mating behavior of Scottish red deer during the breeding season. These behaviors include roaring, fighting, and harem formation, which are crucial in establishing dominance and ensuring reproductive success. By mimicking these biological processes, the RDA effectively balances exploration and exploitation within the solution space, making it well-suited for solving complex optimization problems. Due to its efficiency, the RDA has been used in EV charging related applications including data clustering40, sensor node clustering in wireless sensor networks41 and path planning of inspection robots42.\n\nConceptually, the operation of the RDA is illustrated in the following phases43:\n\nRoaring phase\n\nIn nature, male red deer roar to assert their presence and attract mates. The algorithm models this behavior as a local search process, where solutions explore their neighborhood to improve their fitness. This phase enhances diversification by encouraging the algorithm to search new regions of the solution space.\n\nFighting phase\n\nMale red deer compete through physical contests to establish dominance. In RDA, this is translated into a selection mechanism where candidate solutions are evaluated and the strongest (best fitness) are promoted as “commanders,” while weaker solutions become “stags.” This ensures intensification by focusing on the most promising areas of the solution space.\n\nHarem formation and mating\n\nDominant male deer form harems by attracting females, which they defend and mate with. In RDA, commanders generate new solutions (offspring) by combining their traits with selected females (other solutions). This phase incorporates both local and global exploration, introducing diversity while refining existing solutions.\n\nMathematical framework\n\nKey steps in the RDA are mathematically formulated as follows43:\n\nInitialization:\n\nThe initial population (Npop) is divided into males (Nmale) and females (hinds, Nhind).\n\nA solution is represented as an array:\n\nWhere (Nvar) is the number of decision variables.\n\nRoaring Phase:\n\nMale red deer explore the solution space by updating their positions:\n\nWhere Ub and Lb are the upper and lower bounds, and a1, a2, a3 are random values in [0,1].\n\nFighting Phase:\n\nCommanders (NCom) and stags (Nstag) compete. Two new solutions are generated:\n\nWhere b1, b2 are random parameters, and the better solution is retained.\n\nHarem Formation\n\nThe power (Pn) of a commander determines the proportion of hinds in the harem:\n\nwhere Vn is the normalized fitness of the n-th commander.\n\nMating Phase:\n\nOffspring are generated by mating within and across harems. The offspring solution is:\n\nwhere c is a random parameter.\n\nExploration and exploitation balance\n\nThe Red Deer Algorithm (RDA) balances exploration, which diversifies the search for potential solutions, and exploitation, which refines the best solutions to achieve optimal results. Exploration is driven by the roaring phase, which introduces variability and prevents premature convergence, while exploitation is reinforced by the fighting and mating phases, emphasizing intensification through competition and hierarchical mating. By dynamically adjusting parameters (a, b, c), the RDA adapts to maintain this balance, ensuring effective navigation of the search space and convergence to high-quality solutions in complex optimization problems.\n\nImplementation of RDA\n\nThe flowchart in Fig. 2 outlines a structured process for optimizing EV charging schedules using RDA. The algorithm begins with inputting grid and EV parameters, setting up an initial EV aggregator configuration, and defining constraints and RDA parameters. The algorithm iteratively updates the aggregator’s location and capacity, computes objective functions (e.g., cost minimization and grid stability), and calculates fitness values. Through power dispatch and optimal schedule determination, the process checks for convergence and outputs the final solutions, ensuring an efficient and balanced EV charging strategy while minimizing costs and impact on the grid.\n\nFlowchart of RDA.\n\nRDA’s breeding process, including the mating of stags with the nearest hind, further enhances exploration. The subsequent generation of RDs through the mating process represents the creation of new solutions, reflecting the evolutionary nature of the algorithm. To maintain diversity and prevent premature convergence, weak solutions are also given a chance to contribute to the next generation.\n\nWhile the Red Deer Algorithm (RDA) provides an effective optimization framework for EV scheduling, the economic aspect of charging costs plays a crucial role in influencing EV user behavior and grid stability. To further enhance the effectiveness of EV integration, the following section explores dynamic electricity pricing strategies, particularly Time-of-Use (ToU) pricing, and their impact on optimizing EV charging demand.\n\nDynamic electricity pricing\n\nElectricity pricing has evolved from traditional flat-rate structures to dynamic pricing models, allowing for more efficient energy distribution and demand-side management. Dynamic electricity pricing adjusts tariffs based on real-time supply and demand conditions, aiming to enhance grid stability and incentivize consumers to shift their energy usage to off-peak hours. Among the various dynamic pricing strategies, Time-of-Use (ToU) pricing remains one of the most widely implemented approaches.\n\nToU pricing system establishes electricity rates based on specific time blocks, determined in advance by utilities using historical data rather than real-time demand44. This pricing model provides different electricity tariffs based on three periods: off-peak, mid-peak, and full-peak. During the off-peak period, electricity supply exceeds demand, leading to lower ToU costs. At mid-peak, supply and demand are nearly balanced, resulting in moderate pricing. However, during full-peak hours, electricity consumption surges, necessitating the operation of expensive and less efficient peaking power plants, such as those using diesel, coal, and petroleum. To handle high peak demand, utilities must also invest in infrastructure expansion and additional power generation facilities.\n\nAs electricity generation increases, technical losses within the system also rise, leading to higher peak rates. To mitigate the impact of EV charging on the grid, utilities often rely on infrastructural variations and indirect pricing mechanisms. However, since ToU pricing features high rates only during peak hours and low rates in off-peak periods, it alone is insufficient to effectively manage the influence of EV charging on the power grid.\n\nIn smart grids, Time-of-Use (ToU) pricing is structured so that electricity rates fluctuate based on the grid’s load at different times of the day. The 24-hour period is divided into multiple time intervals {τ1, τ2, ., τq}, each associated with a corresponding grid load {Lτ1, Lτ2, ., Lτq} and a set of discrete pricing levels {Pτ1, Pτ2, ., Pτq}. These prices are selected from a predefined set of discrete values P = {P1, ., Pn}45.\n\nThe pricing mechanism operates on a global scale, ensuring that electricity rates are directly proportional to the grid’s total demand. When demand reaches its highest peak during a specific time slot τθ, the unit price is set to the maximum value Pτθ = max(Pτ1, Pτ2, …, Pτq). Conversely, when the grid load is at its lowest, the pricing is adjusted to the minimum level Pτθ = min(Pτ1, Pτ2, …, Pτq). This dynamic pricing approach optimizes energy consumption patterns, encouraging users to shift their usage to periods of lower demand, thereby improving grid efficiency and stability.\n\nA grid-specific Time-of-Use (ToU) pricing framework is employed to facilitate the practical application of the proposed pricing strategy, which is systematically outlined in the step-by-step algorithm provided below.\n\nAdaptive Pricing Mechanism for EV Charging45.\n\nThe variable κ represents the capacity of the distribution network, while x=(x0,x1,x2,…,x23) denotes the conventional load of the network over a 24-hour period, measured at hourly intervals. The adjusted load values, denoted as x′, are computed using Eq. (18):\n\nwhere ζ serves as a normalization factor. This transformation standardizes the load values to a new range, facilitating further analysis.\n\nThe function f scales the load vector x within the range [1,−1], using ζ as the upper threshold and 0 as the lower threshold. The parameter ζ is selected to ensure that max(x) ≤ ζ < κ, where κκ represents the distribution network’s capacity.\n\nElectric vehicles (EVs) act as flexible loads that can be integrated into the system during periods of low demand, helping to balance the grid by filling demand valleys and maintaining stable operation. To achieve peak shaving and valley filling, the parameters 1 and δ2 are determined using Eqs. (19) and (20), where max(x′) and min (x′) correspond to the highest and lowest values within the normalized load vector x′.\n\nNext, a convex optimization problem is formulated to minimize \\(g(y^{\\prime}+x^{\\prime}+{\\delta _1}+{\\delta _2})\\) where the decision variable y′ is constrained within the range [− 1,1], ensuring that the additional load from EV charging is properly adjusted.\n\nThe values of δ1and δ2 are added element-wise to x′, resulting in y′, which represents the normalized desired EV charging load. The actual charging load y is obtained by denormalizing y′ using Eq. (21):\n\nOnce the desired valley-filling load y is determined, the charging price is assigned based on a ranking system. The maximum and minimum values of y are set as the upper and lower bounds, respectively. The load values are then distributed across the available discrete pricing levels {Pτ1, Pτ2, …, Pτq}. The highest price is assigned to the lowest load, the second-highest price is assigned to the second-lowest load, and this process continues until the highest load is allocated to the lowest price, ensuring an efficient demand-response pricing structure.\n\nThe integration of dynamic electricity pricing, particularly Time-of-Use (ToU) pricing, plays a crucial role in shaping EV charging behaviors and reducing peak demand. However, the real-world impact of these pricing strategies, combined with the proposed optimization framework, must be evaluated through rigorous simulations. The next section presents simulation results, analyzing the effectiveness of the Red Deer Algorithm (RDA) in optimizing EV scheduling and assessing its impact on power distribution networks.\n\nSimulation results and discussion\n\nA demographic-based analysis was conducted to evaluate spatiotemporal patterns in vehicle utilization and charging behavior. The methodology incorporated three vehicle models, each characterized by distinct specifications in terms of battery capacity, operational range, and charging parameters (Tables 1 and 2). Temporal stratification of charging events revealed three primary intervals: morning peak (06:00–10:00), evening peak (15:00–21:00), and off-peak periods. This temporal categorization was derived from empirical observations of charging behavior and network load distributions9.\n\nThe simulation framework incorporated a State of Charge (SoC) threshold parameter of 25%, established to reflect observed user charging behavior patterns. Power demand characterization was conducted using a high-resolution dataset derived from a 69-bus residential distribution network, incorporating both active (P) and reactive (Q) power measurements. The dataset architecture included hierarchical power demand parameters: aggregate network loading, maximum bus capacity utilization, individual nodal demand profiles, and EV charging power consumption patterns. Temporal granularity was maintained at 10-minute intervals throughout the 24-hour analysis period, facilitating comprehensive evaluation of load dynamics and charging patterns.\n\nAdditionally, four distributed generators (DGs) were incorporated into the test network alongside the EVs. The load power demand data was combined with the vehicle specifications from Tables 2 and 3 to address the scheduling optimization problem. This approach aims to manage the charging and discharging of EVs connected to the network without overloading the distribution system. Furthermore, the approach capitalizes for power losses’ reduction and voltage profile improvement.\n\nAverage EV demand\n\nTemporal analysis of energy demand characteristics is presented in Fig. 3, depicting diurnal consumption patterns for six EV configurations (three international and three domestic models) during weekday operational cycles. The profiles delineate charging initialization parameters and temporal duration metrics, correlated with initial and terminal State of Charge (SOC) values. Model validation was conducted through comparative assessment of simulated demand profiles against empirical charging data obtained from operational EVs. Statistical analysis revealed significant correlation coefficients between simulated and measured charging behaviors, substantiating the accuracy and reliability of the computational framework.\n\nProfiles and average energy demand for EVs’ from (a) International market (b) Indian market.\n\nMore in-depth analysis of Fig. 3a and b reveals that the peak demand for both international (1.53 kW) and Indian (1.49 kW) model profiles occurs during the evening hours (4 PM to 10 PM). Notably, the simulated average peak demand aligns closely with the monitored EV charging behavior, suggesting the effectiveness of the EV scheduling optimization. Additionally, individual EV energy demand remains well-managed, with a maximum of 15 kW.\n\nThe results in Fig. 4 were obtained by simulating three scenarios: (1) households without EVs, (2) households with EVs, and (3) a combination of households and EVs. The simulation considered a 24-hour cycle for a 69-bus network with typical residential load patterns. Key assumptions include:\n\nInitial SoC: Randomized between 20% and 80% for the simulated EV fleet.\n\nCharging Power: Based on rated values of the EV models in Tables 1 and 2.\n\nTime Slots: Ten-minute intervals were used to capture dynamic changes.\n\nConstraints: Network voltage limits are 0.95–1.05 p.u., the transformer capacity falls below 100% utilization, and user satisfaction thresholds is set to SoC greater than 80% upon departure.\n\nScenarios: Unmanaged charging (baseline) and optimal scheduling using the proposed algorithm.\n\nThese conditions and constraints were implemented in MATLAB/Simulink to generate aggregated demand profiles with emphasis on the impact of controlled and uncontrolled EV charging. The average EV demand peaks during peak hours (7 AM to 10 AM, 4 PM to 10 PM), ranging from 1.18 kW to 1.74 kW. Notably, this peak demand for EVs is significantly higher than the household power demands, which typically remain below 0.4 kW during peak hours. The results demonstrate that EV integration significantly impacts network power demand characteristics, necessitating the implementation of charging regulation protocols to mitigate peak load conditions across the distribution infrastructure. Analysis reveals equivalent demand patterns across both vehicle model categories, resulting in identical graphical representations. This uniformity in load profiles underscores the consistent impact of EV charging on network demands, independent of vehicle model specifications.\n\nAverage energy demand for 1000 households, EVs and households plus EVs for EVs from (a) international market (b) Indian market.\n\nEVs scheduling and control\n\nNetwork performance characteristics and charging point operational parameters are illustrated in Figs. 5, 6, 7 and 8, demonstrating temporal variations across a 24-hour cycle within a 69-bus feeder infrastructure. Comparative analysis was conducted between controlled and uncontrolled operational scenarios at 100% EV penetration. Uncontrolled charging scenarios exhibited critical transformer overloading of 136% with substantial voltage profile degradation beyond acceptable operational parameters. The implemented scheduling management protocol demonstrated successful regulation of transformer loading within nominal capacity while maintaining voltage profiles within prescribed operational limits. Empirical results suggest the proposed control methodology enables optimization of network hosting capacity approaching 100% EV penetration thresholds.\n\nEV Transformer loading with and without control for (a) International (b) Indian EVs’ Model.\n\nQuantitative analysis of Fig. 5a, focused on international EV models, reveals that implementation of the control algorithm effectively constrained transformer loading to maximum values of approximately 80 kW during peak demand intervals. Similarly, Fig. 5b analysis, centered on domestic (Indian) EV models, demonstrates that the control protocol successfully maintained peak transformer loading at approximately 100 kW, representing a significant reduction from the uncontrolled scenario’s maximum loading of 350 kW. These results quantify the efficacy of the implemented control strategy in mitigating peak transformer loading conditions across both vehicle categories.\n\nComparison of Voltage Profile with and without control cycle for EVs from (a) International and (b) Indian markets.\n\nAnalysis of Fig. 6a reveals that implementation of the control mechanism for international EV models results in a sustained voltage profile exceeding 0.90 per unit (p.u.) across the test network. In the absence of control measures, significant voltage degradation is observed during peak demand periods (17:00–22:00), with values declining below 0.7 p.u. The comparative analysis between controlled and uncontrolled scenarios demonstrates the control system’s efficacy in maintaining network voltage stability. Similarly, Fig. 6b illustrates the control cycle’s effectiveness for Indian EV models, where voltage levels are consistently maintained above 0.9 p.u. throughout the 24-hour operational period. The quantitative comparison between both scenarios provides empirical evidence of the control system’s capability in preserving voltage stability across different EV model configurations.\n\nComparison of aggregated EV power demand with and without control cycles for (a) international and (b) Indian EVs’ models.\n\nTemporal analysis of aggregate EV demand characteristics in Fig. 7a demonstrates the optimization efficacy of implemented charging point management protocols for International Model EVs. The control algorithm implementation (blue curve) achieved a 46.7% reduction in peak demand, from 15 kVA to 8 kVA, relative to the uncontrolled scenario (dotted red curve). The control methodology demonstrates successful attenuation of demand variability during critical loading periods.\n\nFigure 7b illustrates comparative demand profiles for Indian Model EVs under controlled and uncontrolled operational scenarios. The implementation of the optimization protocol resulted in a 33.3% reduction in peak demand, from 9 kVA to 6 kVA, with significant enhancement of load profile stability. The demonstrated load modulation capabilities suggest robust potential for grid stability maintenance under increased EV penetration conditions, particularly during periods of heightened demand volatility.\n\nIndividual EV Charging Behavior with and Without Control (a) International Model (b) Indian Model,\n\nFigure 8 demonstrates the temporal dynamics of EV charging station connectivity patterns in response to aggregate demand fluctuations. The control protocol implements strategic disconnection during peak demand intervals, with subsequent reconnection and charging resumption during reduced network loading conditions, maintaining this cycle until target State of Charge (SoC) parameters are achieved. Analysis of Fig. 8a reveals that uncontrolled charging of international model EVs exhibits extended charging durations during peak periods, initiating at approximately 16:00 and concluding at 00:30. Implementation of the control strategy demonstrates charging duration reduction exceeding 120 min. Figure 8b exhibits analogous behavioral patterns for domestic (Indian) model EVs.\n\nCustomer impact level (CIL)\n\nThe quantitative assessment of direct scheduling impacts on EV charging station operations employed the Customer Impact Level (CIL) metric, as established in reference36. The metric utilizes a decile classification system (groups 0–9) to quantify the proportional increase in charging duration required to achieve target State of Charge (SoC) under implemented management protocols, relative to uncontrolled charging scenarios.\n\nProbability of CIL for EV Charging Control Actions (a) International Model (b) Indian Model.\n\nFigure 9 presents the distributional analysis of Customer Impact Level (CIL) across varying EV penetration scenarios, where each CIL classification represents a 25% incremental deviation in charging duration from scheduled parameters. At 40% penetration levels, charging disruption analysis reveals minimal impact, with 70% of the EV population experiencing negligible temporal deviation (CIL 0). As penetration levels escalate to 60% and beyond, temporal disruptions demonstrate increased prevalence, affecting approximately 60% of the EV fleet. However, the magnitude of impact remains within manageable parameters, with a minimal proportion of EVs experiencing charging duration extensions exceeding 100% of nominal values, even under peak loading conditions. These results validate the efficacy of the implemented EV scheduling protocol in maintaining network operational efficiency.\n\nAggregated EV Availability with EV Management for EVs from (a) International market (b) Indian market.\n\nAnalysis of V2G capacity characteristics presented in Fig. 10 demonstrates the operational viability of aggregated electric vehicles as distributed energy resources within the grid infrastructure. Under implemented management protocols3, the test network exhibited aggregate EV availability coefficients ranging from 0.10 to 0.20 during peak loading periods. This empirical evidence substantiates the feasibility of V2G-enabled EV fleets serving as supplementary power sources during critical grid operational states, effectively functioning as distributed storage systems capable of providing emergency power support. The demonstrated availability patterns suggest significant potential for integration of V2G resources into grid emergency response protocols.\n\nDynamic pricing for charging EVs\n\nFigure 11 demonstrates the temporal correlation between Time-of-Use (ToU) dynamic pricing mechanisms for EV charging and aggregate residential-commercial load profiles. The pricing algorithm exhibits inverse relationship with demand patterns, characterized by rate minimization during off-peak intervals (08:00–12:00 h) coinciding with reduced demand, and significant rate escalation during peak consumption periods (18:00–22:00 h). Residential load follows a similar pattern, reaching its lowest level at midday and peaking in the evening, which coincides with the highest electricity prices. Commercial load, though generally lower than residential demand, also increases after 10 h, peaking around 20 h. This strong correlation between electricity prices and load demand emphasizes the importance of incentivizing EV charging during off-peak hours, ensuring grid stability and reducing operational costs. Encouraging smart charging strategies and Vehicle-to-Grid (V2G) integration can help flatten the demand curve and prevent grid congestion caused by uncontrolled EV charging during peak periods.\n\nTime-of-Use (ToU) Dynamic Pricing and Load Demand Correlation for EV Charging.\n\nComparison of RDA and PSO\n\nTo validate the convergence and correctness of the proposed Red Deer Algorithm (RDA), a comparative analysis was conducted against the widely used Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm. Figure 12 presents comparative convergence characteristics of both algorithms, illustrating the temporal evolution of fitness values across 100 iterative cycles.\n\nConvergence Comparison of Red Deer Algorithm (RDA) and Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO).\n\nFrom Fig. 12, it is evident that RDA demonstrates a significantly faster convergence rate compared to PSO. The RDA achieves a lower fitness value within the first few iterations, indicating a more efficient search capability in reaching near-optimal solutions. In contrast, PSO exhibits a slower descent and stagnates at a suboptimal solution for a longer period before showing minor improvements later in the iterations.\n\nKey observations from the comparative analysis include:\n\nFaster Convergence of RDA: The RDA algorithm rapidly decreases the fitness value within early iterations, reaching an optimal or near-optimal solution much faster than PSO. The accelerated convergence to optimal or near-optimal solutions, relative to PSO, indicates enhanced exploration-exploitation equilibrium in the search space dynamics.\n\nStability of Converged Solution: RDA demonstrates superior terminal convergence characteristics, achieving stabilization at a lower fitness value threshold compared to PSO. This reduced terminal fitness value validates RDA’s enhanced capability in identifying global optima for complex optimization problems.\n\nPSO Convergence Limitation: PSO algorithm exhibits persistent elevation in fitness values over extended iteration cycles, indicating reduced adaptation efficiency within complex solution spaces. This prolonged maintenance of higher fitness levels suggests compromised search space exploration capabilities, potentially resulting in premature convergence to local optimal solutions rather than global minima.\n\nPerformance Comparison of RDA and PSO: The performance comparison of two optimization methods on the IEEE 69-bus system, PSO and RDA, is shown in this convergence graph. PSO’s goal function begins at a high value and then progressively drops with very slight variations. It takes about 83 iterations to reach a final value and shows a slower rate of convergence than RDA. In contrast, RDA likewise begins at a high value but declines more quickly in the initial iterations. Compared to PSO, it stabilizes earlier and shows a more noticeable improvement in the first 55 iterations.\n\nThese findings confirm the effectiveness of the proposed optimization framework in minimizing power losses, improving voltage stability, and optimizing EV charging schedules. The results further demonstrate that the Red Deer Algorithm (RDA) outperforms Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) in terms of convergence speed and solution quality. The final section provides a summary of key insights, highlights existing limitations, and proposes future research directions to enhance the seamless integration of EVs into smart grid systems.\n\nConclusion\n\nThis study provides a comprehensive analysis of EVs charging practices, their impact on distribution systems, and the effectiveness of the proposed scheduling strategies using Red Deer Algorithm (RDA). Two distinct EV models – selected from International and Indian markets, respectively - differing in battery capacity and range, to ensure a broad applicability of the findings.\n\nThe simulations of hourly energy demand profiles demonstrated strong correlation with actual EV charging behavior, validating the accuracy of our models. Peak demands for both EV types occurred during morning (8 AM to 10 AM) and evening (6 PM to 10 PM) hours, highlighting critical periods for potential network stress.\n\nThe comparison between EV and household power demands underscored the significant increase in network load due to EV charging, particularly during peak hours. This emphasized the need for effective EV charging regulation to mitigate high load demands across distribution networks.\n\nTo address these challenges, an EV scheduling strategy that simultaneously optimizes two objectives: maximizing power and reducing power losses, using the Red Deer Algorithm (RDA) was proposed. This approach demonstrated remarkable effectiveness in maintaining transformer utilization below rated capacity and voltage levels within specified ranges, even under high EV penetration scenarios. Key achievements of our proposed strategy include:\n\nSignificant decrease in power loss, even with a large fleet of EVs connected to the grid simultaneously for charging and discharging operations.\n\nImproved voltage profiles and consistent EV aggregate power.\n\nReduced EV charging times, even during peak hours.\n\nPotential increase in the hosting capacity of distribution networks.\n\nThe Customer Impact Level (CIL) metric revealed that while charging disruptions increase with higher EV penetration levels, the impact remains manageable. This demonstrates the positive influence of our EV scheduling on network efficiency while minimizing disruptions to EV users.\n\nFurthermore, the study highlighted the potential of Vehicle-to-Grid (V2G) technology. With EV management in place, we observed an aggregated EV availability of 10–20% during peak hours, suggesting that V2G-enabled EVs could serve as a valuable supplementary power source during emergency situations.\n\nThe proposed solution proves to be practical and scalable for similar aggregator- Distribution System Operators (DSO) approaches. Additionally, our EV scheduling model allows for quantification of potential network resources to assist in maintaining the equilibrium between demand and generation.\n\nIn conclusion, this research emphasizes the crucial role of intelligent EV charging management in ensuring grid stability and efficiency as EV adoption continues to grow. The proposed scheduling strategies show promise in maximizing network capacity while minimizing disruptions to EV users, paving the way for smoother integration of EVs into existing power distribution systems. These findings provide valuable insights for both EV aggregators and DSOs in optimizing their operations and planning for a future with increased EV penetration.\n\nData availability\n\nThe datasets used and/or analyzed during the current study are available from the corresponding author on reasonable request.\n\nReferences\n\nHajibandeh, N., Ehsan, M., Soleymani, S., Shafie-khah, M. & Catalão, J.

The subsequent sections delve into the details of each of these components and their applications within the framework.\n\nGaussian process model for electric vehicle charging demand\n\nThe Gaussian Process Model is an advanced approach for uncovering the underlying relationships between input and output variables within a system. Unlike traditional AI-based models that aim to discover unknown relationships between inputs and outputs, Gaussian Process Models take into account model complexity while minimizing training errors, providing a more nuanced approach to modeling. In the context of electric vehicle charging demand and considering constraints and a trade-off parameter C, this Gaussian Process model can be represented as follows\n\nwhere:\n\nThe mean function represents the expected charging demand and can be a nonlinear function of input variables. It characterizes the trend of the data.\n\nThe Radial Basis Function (RBF) kernel captures smooth and continuous variations in charging demand data. It is defined as:\n\nwhere is the standard deviation of the kernel, controlling the smoothness of the function.\n\nThe constraints ensure that the model respects the training data and maintains a trade-off between complexity and training error. The constraints are as follows:\n\nwhere:\n\nTo solve for the model parameters, including the kernel hyperparameters, mean function parameters, and trade-off parameter C, we need to minimize the following objective:\n\nSubject to the defined constraints.\n\nThe predictions for charging demand at a new point x are based on the model’s mean function:\n\nwhere is the predicted charging demand at x.\n\nThe uncertainty in the predictions can be estimated using the RBF kernel:\n\nIn selecting appropriate values for the parameters and within the Radial Basis Function kernel, meticulous consideration is paramount. These values should be chosen to comprehensively represent charging scenarios while balancing similarity and diversity to bolster model performance and generalization. Furthermore, understanding the impact of different values on the overall performance is critical for optimizing model accuracy and robustness. For instance, selecting smaller values for and in the Radial Basis Function (RBF) kernel might lead to smoother predictions with reduced variance but could potentially overlook intricate patterns in the charging demand data. Conversely, larger values for these parameters might capture more complex variations in the data but could result in overfitting and decreased generalization to unseen data points. By systematically exploring various combinations of and values across a range of scenarios and datasets, researchers can gain insights into the trade-offs between model complexity, predictive accuracy, and computational efficiency. This iterative process of experimentation and analysis is essential for fine-tuning the Gaussian Process Model and optimizing its performance for diverse electric vehicle charging demand scenarios.\n\nOptimization technique\n\nTesting various techniques, particularly those inspired by natural algorithms like the Krill Herd Algorithm (KHA), is crucial for fine-tuning the setting parameters of C and in the Gaussian Process Model, ensuring accurate predictions in electric vehicle charging demand modeling. This comprehensive evaluation helps identify the most effective optimization strategy, enhancing the model’s predictive performance.\n\nInitialize Krill Individuals: Generate an initial population of krill individuals, each represented as with a position in the search space and associated GRP parameters C and . Initialize their positions randomly within the search space:\n\nwhere are the minimum and maximum values for , C, and .\n\nEvaluate Objective Function:\n\nEvaluate the fitness of each krill by applying GRP with the associated and values to the dataset.

Calculate the new position based on the attraction factor:\n\nwhere\n\nDistraction Movement:\n\nKrill react to threats (less promising solutions) by moving away. Calculate the new position based on the distraction factor:\n\nwhere\n\nIn optimizing the Gaussian Process Model for electric vehicle charging demand modeling, selecting parameter values in the Krill Herd Algorithm (KHA) is pivotal for accurate predictions and efficient optimization. Parameter choices, including the separation (), alignment (), cohesion (), attraction (), and distraction () factors, play a crucial role in achieving this balance between exploration and exploitation. Prioritizing values that promote both exploration and exploitation ensures adequate exploration of the solution space while exploiting promising regions. This prevents premature convergence to suboptimal solutions while facilitating convergence towards the global optimum. Furthermore, parameter values are tailored to the characteristics of the data, such as its complexity, size, and variability. For instance, smaller values may be preferred in scenarios with high variability or sparse data to encourage more exploration, while larger values may be suitable in scenarios with well-defined patterns or abundant data to emphasize exploitation and refine solutions efficiently\n\nIn the final stages of the optimization process, inspired by the Krill Algorithm, several crucial steps are taken to fine-tune parameters and achieve an optimal solution. Initially, parameters , , , , and are dynamically adjusted using adaptive formulas, drawing inspiration from the Krill Algorithm’s adaptability.\n\nFollowing parameter adjustment, the optimization process involves updating the best solution identified thus far, guided by the Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) performance metric. This ensures that promising solutions are retained and leveraged to enhance overall optimization.\n\nConversely, the worst solution encountered during the optimization process is utilized as a reference point, serving as a measure of the adversary in the pursuit of an optimal outcome. This dual evaluation approach enables the optimization process to strike a balance between exploring potential improvements and avoiding less favorable solutions.\n\nThese iterative optimization steps, encompassing parameter adjustment, solution enhancement, and adversary avoidance, are reiterated in a cyclical manner. This iterative process continues for a defined number of iterations, denoted as MaxIter, or until convergence is attained based on a predefined stopping criterion. This dynamic and adaptive approach, inspired by the Krill Algorithm, contributes to the progressive refinement of the solution space, ultimately converging towards an optimal outcome.

This strategy is modeled using a normal distribution function:\n\nwhere and .\n\nOnce the starting time is known, the charging demand of HEVs can be determined. The average mileage of each vehicle can be estimated as follows:\n\nWith the estimated mileage (m), the State of Charge (SoC) of the battery is determined using a straightforward equation:\n\nwhere ER represents the total electric range, and exceeding this range results in the vehicle shutting down.\n\nConsidering SoC and battery capacity (), the charging duration can be estimated as follows:\n\nwhere is the charger power and represents the charging efficiency. Tables 1 and 2 provide information about four charger types corresponding to four different classes of HEVs. This data will be used in subsequent simulation results for a comprehensive analysis.\n\nCharger types in HEVs.\n\nHEV classes.\n\nThe market share of HEVs is randomly determined based on their type/class (Table 2) with a normal distribution function with characteristics of mean and standard deviation as below:\n\nProblem setup\n\nIn the realm of energy management, the primary responsibility of the operator revolves around ensuring the dependable and secure supply of energy to electrical consumers, all while striving to minimize expenses . As a result, the objective function combines operational costs and technical expenditures, manifesting in the following manner Minimize the total cost, considering both operating and technical costs:\n\nOperating cost constraints for distributed generators (DGs)\n\nConstraints related to energy storage systems\n\nConstraints related to adjustable load demand\n\nConstraints related to DGs and energy storage systems\n\nConstraints for total energy stored in batteries\n\nConstraints for bus voltage and main grid power limits\n\nConstraints for reconfiguration using remote switches\n\nElectric vehicle\n\nVoltage limit\n\nCurrent limit\n\nThe charging patterns of Hybrid Electric Vehicles (HEVs) are influenced by a multitude of factors, including market penetration, State of Charge (SoC), charging duration, and more. To seamlessly integrate HEVs into the system, it is crucial to precisely define these uncertain parameters, thereby reducing inherent variability. This study employs the Support Vector Regression (SVR) method to predict the overall charging demands of HEVs.\n\nFrom a technical perspective, HEVs are versatile in their ability to draw energy from either traditional gasoline or electricity sources. Figure 2 offers an overview of the fundamental components of HEVs35. In this representation, the cylindrical component signifies fuel storage, emphasizing that HEVs operate by harnessing power from both electrical and fossil fuel sources. To extend this discussion to microgrid energy management, it’s essential to consider how constraint parameters are selected to optimize system performance and stability.In this study, the selection of constraint parameters was methodically driven by a deep understanding of the microgrid’s unique characteristics and operational needs. The research team began by closely examining the size and complexity of the microgrid, alongside the types of distributed energy resources (DERs) integrated within it. This analysis allowed for the tailoring of constraints to match the capabilities of the specific DERs, ensuring they could effectively meet demand without jeopardizing system stability. For instance, when defining the Active and Reactive Power Limits for distributed generators (DGs), meticulous consideration was given to each generator’s capacity and operational behavior. By aligning limits with the capabilities of these generators, the aim was to strike a balance between meeting demand and preventing system overload. The approach to Energy Storage System parameters involved a thorough assessment of storage capacity and anticipated load fluctuations. By carefully selecting charging and discharging times, the goal was to optimize energy storage utilization while minimizing disruptions to grid operations. Adjustable Load Demand constraints were chosen to provide the desired level of flexibility in managing load demands, all while ensuring compatibility with available generation capacity. This involved a nuanced understanding of the microgrid’s load profile and resource capabilities. Similarly, Bus Voltage and Main Grid Power Limits were tailored to maintain voltage stability and manage power flow within acceptable thresholds, accounting for the microgrid’s specific infrastructure and operational needs. Finally, parameters governing Reconfiguration Using Remote Switches were designed to enhance the microgrid’s reliability and resilience, enabling efficient adaptation to changing conditions\n\nPower flow analysis and voltage stability\n\nThe power flow equations within a microgrid are vital for ensuring reliable operation and voltage stability. They are typically addressed using iterative methods such as the Newton-Raphson approach. One key equation is the power balance equation at each node, which maintains overall power balance by equating injected and withdrawn power. Mathematically, this equation ensures that the sum of injected active and reactive power equals the sum of withdrawn power at each node:\n\nwhere and represent the injected active and reactive power at node i, and and represent the withdrawn active and reactive power at node i. Another critical aspect of power flow analysis is the relationship between voltage magnitudes and phase angles at neighboring nodes. This relationship governs power flow across transmission lines and ensures voltage stability within the system. Mathematically, the relationship between voltage magnitudes and phase angles at node i and its neighboring node j can be expressed as:\n\nwhere and are the voltage magnitudes at nodes i and j, and are the phase angles at nodes i and j, is the impedance of the transmission line connecting nodes i and j, and is the complex current flowing from node i to node j. The Newton-Raphson method is employed to iteratively solve these nonlinear equations, adjusting node voltages until power mismatches meet acceptable criteria. By doing so, it ensures balanced power distribution and maintains voltage stability within acceptable thresholds, addressing operating security concerns. The study’s methodology addresses challenges related to power flow constraints, including fluctuating demand and intermittent renewable energy sources, by integrating advanced optimization techniques into the Newton-Raphson algorithm. By doing so, the study aims to enhance the resilience and efficiency of microgrid operation in the face of dynamic energy demands and environmental variability. In the context of microgrid energy management, the selection of parameters for power flow analysis and voltage stability is crucial for ensuring reliable operation and system resilience. When determining these values, various factors specific to the microgrid’s characteristics and operational requirements must be considered. Firstly, the impedance values () of transmission lines connecting different nodes within the microgrid are chosen based on factors such as line length, material, and loading conditions. These values directly influence the relationship between voltage magnitudes and phase angles, as described by Equation (46). Selecting appropriate impedance values ensures efficient power transfer and voltage stability across the microgrid. Additionally, the criteria for acceptable power mismatches and voltage thresholds are established to maintain system stability under varying operating conditions. These criteria are determined based on factors such as load variations, renewable energy generation fluctuations, and grid disturbances. Optimizing these criteria involves striking a balance between system stability and operational efficiency. Furthermore, the selection of parameters for the Newton-Raphson method, such as convergence criteria and iteration limits, plays a crucial role in the accuracy and efficiency of power flow analysis. Setting appropriate values for these parameters ensures that the iterative solution converges to a stable solution within a reasonable computational time. The impact of these parameter selections on overall performance is significant. For example, overly conservative impedance values may result in excessive voltage drops and power losses, leading to reduced system efficiency. Conversely, overly aggressive convergence criteria may increase computational burden without significant improvement in accuracy.\n\nLimitations\n\nWhile the proposed methodology represents a significant advancement in microgrid management, it is essential to acknowledge certain limitations inherent in its components. One potential limitation arises from the computational complexity associated with solving power flow equations using the Newton-Raphson method. Although effective for voltage stability analysis and power flow optimization in steady-state conditions, the iterative nature of this approach demands significant computational resources, particularly in large microgrid networks or real-time applications. Despite advancements in computing technology, managing these computational demands remains a consideration for practical implementation. Similarly, the Krill algorithm’s sensitivity to parameter settings and its reliance on underlying assumptions pose another limitation. Suboptimal parameter choices or deviations from assumed model dynamics may lead to subpar performance or convergence issues. However, conducting sensitivity analysis and careful parameter calibration during algorithm development can mitigate this limitation to a large extent. Additionally, the Gaussian Process Model’s effectiveness relies on the assumption of stationarity in underlying data distributions. In real-world scenarios where renewable energy dynamics exhibit non-stationary behavior, predictive accuracy may be compromised. Techniques such as kernel selection and hyperparameter tuning can enhance the model’s adaptability, but addressing non-stationarity remains a consideration. Moreover, integrating advanced optimization techniques like stochastic dynamic programming introduces additional computational overhead. While these techniques enhance robustness and resilience to uncertainty, they also extend optimization timeframes. However, with careful algorithm design and optimization, these computational demands can be managed effectively without compromising performance. In summary, while the methodology presents several limitations, such as computational complexity and sensitivity to parameter settings, addressing these challenges through careful analysis and algorithmic optimization ensures its continued effectiveness in microgrid management.\n\nSimulation and results\n\nTo evaluate the performance of the proposed machine learning model, the IEEE Microgrid test system is used, which is shown in Fig. 3. A Microgrid combines two wind turbines, two solar panels and a separate switch. Hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs) are placed evenly throughout the network, enabling charging based on their probability distribution, but equally across all buses. Connections connect the vehicle and provide flexibility for reconfiguration through 73 of the built-in components, 68 of which are separable. The Microgrid derives a large part of its electricity load from renewable sources, namely wind and solar power. The wind turbines of 142 and 250 kW follow the comparative efficiency model, which is demonstrated by the wind turbines of 200 and 180 kW to simplify the presentation. The raw data in Table 3 provides an overview of the total HEV charging needs and shows the unpredictability of HEV charging needs. The purpose of the proposed model, as described in Section 3, is to intelligently or collectively predict and distribute the total charge on the target day of operation. Figure 3 shows the battery storage units in the Microgrid, defined in Table 4. Four adjustable loads are taken into account within the Microgrid, with certain loads exhibiting shiftable characteristics defined in Table 5. Over a six-month period, historical data on the total energy charging demand of HEVs in the test system is utilized to train the proposed models .Parameters undergo adjustment and fixation through the Modified Differential Evolution Algorithm (MDA). Consequently, the proposed models provide predictions for the total charging demand of HEVs over a 24-hour cycle. Figure 4 depicts the Renewable Energy Sources Generation profile over a 24-hour period, emphasizing the dynamic output of solar and wind energy, showcasing their fluctuations and contributions to the overall energy generation throughout the day.To ensure fairness in comparison, the prediction period extends to 20 days, encompassing established methods such as ARMA, ANN, SVR, along with the proposed technique Krill defined in Table 6. The accuracy of predictions is then assessed, with an evaluation based on three key criteria: Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE), Mean Absolute Relative Percentage Error (MARPE), and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE). (ARMA) exhibits moderate performance with a MAPE of 2.09 %, indicating reasonably accurate predictions, but it falls short in comparison to the precision achieved by Krill algorithm. Artificial Neural Network (ANN) and Support Vector Regression (SVR) showcase respectable performance, yet their MAPE values of 2.26% and 1.37% respectively suggest a marginally higher level of prediction error compared to the superior accuracy achieved by the krill Algorithm in this context.\n\nFigure 3.\n\nIEEE grid system41.\n\nTable 3.\n\nHistorical charging demand data for HEVs (MWh).\n\nTable 4.\n\nCharacteristics of energy storage.\n\nTable 5.\n\nLoad characteristics (S: Shiftable, C: Curtailable).\n\nFigure 4.\n\nRenewable energy sources generation.\n\nTable 6.\n\nPerformance metrics for different methods.\n\nThe introduction of the Krill Herd Algorithm (KHA) to the prediction landscape reveals promising outcomes, with a MAPE of 1.02%. This underscores the algorithm’s effectiveness in predicting HEV charging demand.\n\nAssessing the system’s performance at peak load hours involves a comparison of different charging strategies, distributing total load demand through coordinated and intelligent approaches. Figure 5 visually presents the HEV charging demand curves for the Krill algorithm.It illustrate energy consumption patterns for both Intelligent Charging (IC) and Coordinated Charging (CC). It is noteworthy that coordinated charging consistently demonstrates lower power consumption than intelligent charging throughout the entire 24-hour period, indicating its effectiveness in promoting a balanced and sustainable energy utilization strategy. The krill technique exhibits remarkable efficiency, illustrated by coordinated charging consuming 430 KW compared to 160 KW for intelligent charging during the peak consumption hour. The depicted optimization, as illustrated in Fig. 6, underscores the effectiveness of Krill in managing energy output, showcasing its capability to efficiently adapt and respond to diverse demands within the specified range from 2100 KWH to a maximum capacity.The proposed strategy keep consistently demonstrates lower power consumption, ranging. This consistent superiority in minimizing power usage suggests that krill Reduction is more effective in optimizing Microgrid cost compared to classical techniques. Figure 7 illustrate the hourly market prices for the Microgrid under the proposed technique.The time-dependent pricing unveils varying cost structures over the 24-hour period. Krill exhibits fluctuating prices, reaching a peak at 3.375/kWh during hours 10, 11, and 12, indicating a potential high-cost period. To assess the efficiency of the proposed algorithms in optimizing energy management, we conduct a comparative analysis with Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), Genetic Algorithm (GA), and other proposed techniques. Table 7 presents cost and CPU time results for 24 hours over 40 trials, showcasing krill’s superior performance. Notably, even krill’s worst solution outperforms the best solutions from other systems, demonstrating robust optimization capabilities. The close alignment of the average index with the best solution underscores the reliability of the optimization process. Additionally, krill exhibits efficient computational performance, achieving optimal power sharing and unit scheduling in less time with minimal efforts. The lower standard deviation further emphasizes the robustness of the proposed algorithm. Remarkably, krill excels in CPU time efficiency, reducing it from 17.269 seconds to 14.248 seconds. This significant improvement highlights the computational advantages of the krill algorithm, ensuring faster convergence for optimal microgrid management. Moreover, its consistent cost-effectiveness, with a competitive cost profile compared to alternative algorithms, reinforces its reliability and efficiency in real-world applications. Figure 8 illustrate the total cost of the different optimization techniques.It can be noted from the figure and Table 7 that the krill outperforming other algorithms, which appear to become ensnared in local optima. Table 8 illustrates the optimized output power for the solar panel, wind turbine, and charging demand of the HEVs over a 24-hour period, as determined by the proposed method. The outcomes indicate that the renewable units are consistently generating power in accordance with the anticipated results.To enrich the comparative analysis, Fig. 9 vividly portrays the microgrid’s hourly cost over a 24-hour period, both before and after the implementation of network reconfiguration. The visual representation underscores the substantial benefits of network reconfiguration, showcasing remarkable reductions in losses and improved unit dispatch efficiency for the krill optimization technique. Moreover, the system consistently registers lower costs across each hour, underscoring the pivotal role of the switching process. These findings solidify the efficacy of the proposed model in optimizing renewable microgrids. Tables 9 unveil the optimal scheduling of the storage unit and adjustable loads in the microgrid for the three proposed techniques. In Table 9, the battery showcases a charging pattern in the early hours, followed by discharge in later hours, leading to a reduction in overall microgrid operation costs. This cyclic charging and discharging in the afternoon underscore the effectiveness of this strategy, with adjustable loads aptly scheduled within available time slots. Figure 10 compares the microgrid operation costs for intelligent charging and coordinated charging of HEV power demand. Intelligent charging, shifting demand to off-peak hours, consistently outperforms coordinated charging, resulting in lower costs 369,948.25 vs. 482,057.25. This strategy not only reduces total microgrid costs but also improves technical aspects, such as voltage profiles and alleviation of potential feeder congestion. The numbers highlight the economic advantage of intelligent charging, emphasizing its role in enhancing overall microgrid efficiency and financial viability. After determining the superior performance of the krill algorithm, a dynamic pricing model was developed to evaluate the system’s efficacy under renewable energy fluctuations. Applying the krill algorithm to this model yielded a responsive pricing structure, fluctuating between 0.08/kWh and 2.5/kWh throughout the day (shown in Fig. 11). This numerical illustration highlights the algorithm’s ability to adapt pricing dynamically to hourly variations, confirming its effectiveness in optimizing cost considerations. Furthermore, to comprehensively analyze the microgrid system’s performance, a sensitivity study assessed how variations in renewable energy generation capacity impact operational costs. This systematic approach explored different scenarios, revealing insights to optimize economic efficiency in real-world implementations. The analysis unveiled a non-linear relationship between renewable energy capacity and operational costs: initially, costs decreased gradually with greater reliance on renewables, but beyond a threshold, diminishing returns were observed (see Fig. 12). The insights gained from this sensitivity test lay the groundwork for future implementation and testing of our sustainable approach and represent a crucial step towards empirical validation in real-world environments. While the simulation environment adopted in this study is comprehensive, it may not fully encompass the intricacies of real-world complexities. The next critical step in our research agenda involves an in-depth investigation and empirical testing of this optimization approach in practical applications. This transition from simulation to real-world experimentation is imperative to validate and refine the proposed methodologies, ensuring their robustness and applicability in diverse operational settings. By conducting empirical testing, we aim to bridge the gap between theoretical concepts and practical implementation, ultimately advancing the field of renewable microgrid management.\n\nFigure 5.\n\nComparative analysis of microgrid operation: coordinated vs. intelligent charging strategies with Krill optimization.\n\nFigure 6.\n\nEnergy consumption in microgrid operations resulted from through krill.\n\nFigure 7.\n\nKrill market dynamics: hourly price variations in microgrid operations.\n\nTable 7.\n\nComparative analysis of optimization algorithms.\n\nFigure 8.\n\nPerformance analysis: convergence patterns of diverse optimization strategies for total cost function optimization.\n\nTable 8.\n\nOutput power of wind units and solar panels along with the charging demands of HEVs.\n\nFigure 9.\n\nHourly expenditure of the microgrid pre and post optimal switching operations through krill.\n\nTable 9.\n\nOptimal switching pattern in the microgrid with a 25% improvement.\n\nFigure 10.\n\nRelative operational expenses in coordinated and intelligent charging scenarios for microgrid.\n\nFigure 11.\n\nDynamic fluctuation model.\n\nFigure 12.\n\nSensitivity analysis: impact of renewable energy generation capacity.\n\nThe provided tables illustrate the optimal switching patterns in a microgrid, detailing the activation states of Sectionalizing and Tie Switches across 24 hours.

Firefly optimization demonstrates superior performance in terms of minimizing Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) and Mean Absolute Deviation (MAD), indicating higher precision and accuracy in optimization results. However, Krill Harmony may offer cost advantages in terms of the objective function.\n\nConclusion\n\nIn summary, this study introduces an innovative machine learning approach to address challenges in managing hybrid electric vehicle (HEV) charging demand within renewable microgrids.

To contribute to this problem solving, a multi-objective framework for EV demands response in power systems, optimizing charging and discharging schedules while considering maximum load-handling capacity and EV users’ state of charge (SoC) satisfaction as constraints are proposed. The framework employs a vehicle-to-grid (V2G) approach to achieve these goals. The proposed model, centered on aggregators and EV users, tackles issues such as power loss reduction, voltage profile enhancement, and optimal EV charging and discharging scheduling to maximize system performance. For this aim, we address this problem as a multi-objective optimization one using a linear weighted sum technique to simultaneously address the framework objectives. To tackle the optimization problem, a metaheuristic swarm intelligence algorithm, the Red Deer Algorithm (RDA), is utilized to determine the optimal EV charging and discharging timings. The efficiency of the proposed method on a IEEE 69-bus system is tested. The experiment simulates residential EV loads using two sets of different EVs; The first set included Tata Nexon, BYD Seal and Hyundai Ioniq and the second set included Nissan Leaf e+, MG ZS EV Long Range and Mercedes EQS AMG 53 4MATIC+. These vehicles, with different charging powers, are connected to the network via load or generator buses based on household demands. The aim was to determine the optimal power flow for charging and analyze the impact of EV integration during peak and off-peak hours. Simulation results demonstrated that the EV schedule management method significantly reduces average EV load demand without overloading the distribution network’s power flow, while maintaining an improved voltage profile. Furthermore, by integrating drone technology, EVs can transmit stored information back to the grid, enhancing the overall energy management beyond power consumption.\n\nSimilar content being viewed by others\n\nA multi-objective optimization framework for EV-integrated distribution grids using the hiking optimization algorithm\n\nOptimal scheduling of solar powered EV charging stations in a radial distribution system using opposition-based competitive swarm optimization\n\nA TOPSIS based multi-objective optimal deployment of solar PV and BESS units in power distribution system electric vehicles load demand\n\nIntroduction\n\nAmid the ongoing energy crisis and increasing environmental concerns caused by classical fossil fuel energy sources, optimizing renewable energy utilization has become a critical area of research and innovation, engaging engineers, policymakers, and industry practitioners. Distributed generation (DG), particularly from renewable sources, plays a pivotal role in enhancing efficiency and promoting environmentally sustainable electricity production. However, integrating renewable distributed generation into power systems introduces operational complexities due to the inherent variability and intermittency of these sources. To address these challenges, demand response (DR) has emerged as a key mechanism to enhance grid reliability, offering greater flexibility and maintaining a balanced supply-demand relationship.\n\nThe significance of DR in power system operations has been extensively studied from multiple perspectives. As examples, one study evaluated DR programs as a viable alternative to conventional generation methods, particularly in wind-integrated systems, analyzing the effectiveness of tariff-based and incentive-based strategies in optimizing grid stability and economic efficiency1. Another research highlighted DR’s crucial role in improving power system reliability during extreme weather events, emphasizing the importance of well-structured market mechanisms to maximize its potential2. Additionally, an innovative agent-based framework was proposed to enhance demand-side flexibility, where a central demand response provider (DRP) efficiently coordinates industrial and residential aggregators, enabling optimal load management and improved energy efficiency3.\n\nElectric vehicles (EVs) significantly contribute to carbon dioxide (CO₂) reduction and grid management through demand response (DR) programs. Their integration into Vehicle-to-Grid (V2G) systems enables efficient energy transfer, but their limited battery capacity necessitates aggregator involvement for effective participation4. In addition, aggregators facilitate energy flow management and market participation, optimizing prices and increasing revenue for EV owners. However, technological barriers, such as the need for advanced bidirectional charging systems, and regulatory challenges require policy updates to support V2G interactions5. Future advancements in battery technology and increased public awareness are crucial for widespread adoption. Addressing infrastructure and regulatory issues will be key to maximizing EV benefits in DR programs.\n\nAggregators play a vital role in enabling electric vehicle (EV) users to participate in the energy market, but they are facing challenges due to the unpredictable charging behavior of EV owners, which affects grid stability and market efficiency6. Technical issues, such as uncontrolled charging leading to power quality concerns, necessitate smart solutions like Vehicle-to-Grid (V2G) technology. In energy markets, aggregators must balance efficiency and fairness in resource allocation7. Despite these challenges, coordinated strategies can enhance grid stability, optimize costs, and improve renewable energy integration. Engaging prosumers may further strengthen flexibility and resilience in the energy system, highlighting the potential of aggregators to drive market efficiency and system reliability8.\n\nOperating as private entities, aggregators consistently aim to maximize their profits through various strategies. These may include offering additional services9 and participating in secondary reserve markets within the electrical system. The complex interplay between aggregator objectives, EV user needs, and grid requirements underscores the importance of optimized management strategies in this evolving landscape. Collaborative efforts among multiple aggregators have the potential to enhance DR flexibility and improve service quality for customers, even with relatively simple infrastructure configurations at each station. For instance, a centralized hierarchical framework where the Distribution System Operator (DSO) coordinates charging across all aggregators to minimize energy purchase costs under Time-of-Use (TOU) tariffs and achieve peak load control is proposed. This approach may facilitate cooperation between multiple aggregators and distribution operators. However, this approach may also raise concerns regarding data privacy and personal financial security.\n\nCoordinating EV aggregators without a central controller relies on distributed optimization algorithms and incentive-based mechanisms to enhance system efficiency. Neurodynamic-based algorithms can optimize real-time bidding strategies7, while alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) enables collaborative optimization between network operators and aggregators10. Incentive models like Nash Bargaining Theory promote fair trading7, and Peer-to-Peer Trading reduces costs and risks11. Overcoming challenges in fairness and distributed energy management is key to sustainable EV grid integration.\n\nThis paper comprehensively examines and quantifies the benefits for the above cited three stakeholders. For this purpose, we propose an enhanced model of EV user satisfaction that accounts for the nonlinear relationship between changes in the EV State of Charge (SoC) and user satisfaction with aggregator services. Based on this analysis, we suggest an optimal scheduling algorithm for aggregator operations. This algorithm enables aggregators to maximize their profits while meeting the minimum DR capability standards set by the distribution network and satisfying EV user requirements.\n\nThis study focuses on residential aggregators, emphasizing service quality, DR performance, and the time-space statistics of EV behaviors. This focus is motivated by the limited range of EV batteries and the correlation of charging and discharging behaviors across different stations. The interrelation between EV user service requests, the profit of multiple aggregators, and their economic incentives for DR program participation is explored, considering the stringent charging requirements of EV consumers.\n\nThis research introduces a multi-objective optimization framework that integrates grid constraints, time-of-use (TOU) pricing structures, and consumer satisfaction while optimizing EV charging and discharging schedules. Unlike conventional methods, this framework dynamically manages the unpredictability of EV charging behaviors while ensuring flexibility in real-time energy demand response. A key advantage of this approach is its ability to assess the impact of TOU pricing under varying demand scenarios, effectively balancing peak and off-peak load variations. Moreover, State of Charge (SoC) constraints are incorporated to adaptively accommodate fluctuating EV charging requirements. Distinct from conventional algorithms such as Genetic Algorithms (GA) and Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), this study employs a Red Deer Algorithm (RDA)-based optimization framework to jointly optimize EV charging/discharging schedules, grid balancing, and energy demand forecasting. By integrating V2G capabilities, the proposed approach enables EVs to supply energy back into the grid, enhancing overall grid stability and energy flow management. Additionally, the innovative incorporation of drones for real-time data exchange between EVs and the grid may further improve communication efficiency, allowing for better energy allocation and charging station utilization.\n\nThe proposed optimization framework effectively addresses scalability challenges in large-scale test cases involving thousands of variables. Utilizing the Red Deer Algorithm (RDA), a metaheuristic approach balancing exploration and exploitation within the optimization problem search-space, the method ensures efficient scheduling of EV charging and discharging while maintaining grid stability. The IEEE 69-bus test system, with a diverse fleet of EVs, was used to validate the framework, demonstrating its capability to optimize power flow without overloading the grid. The multi-objective optimization approach, incorporating a linear weighted sum technique, efficiently handles constraints such as State of Charge (SoC), load demand variations, and peak/off-peak energy pricing. Compared to traditional algorithms, RDA reduces computational complexity through hierarchical population structuring and intelligent local search mechanisms. Empirical validation with over 1000 households confirmed the approach’s effectiveness in minimizing peak load impact while dynamically adapting to grid constraints. Additionally, real-time drone-assisted data exchange may contribute in enhancing decision-making accuracy in distributed environments, making the method robust for large-scale applications.\n\nThe remainder of this paper is structured as follows: Sect. \"Literature review\" presents a comprehensive literature review, divided into six subsections covering key aspects such as the role of aggregators in EV energy management, optimization techniques for EV aggregation, stakeholder considerations, advanced control and machine learning techniques, microgrid stability enhancement through V2G integration, and identified research gaps.

The adoption of DERs, including solar, wind energy, and electric vehicles (EVs), offers numerous benefits, such as reducing greenhouse gas emissions, improving energy flexibility, and enhancing system resilience and reliability12. Among DERs, EVs are rapidly gaining importance due to their potential for bidirectional energy exchange with the grid. Aggregators play a crucial role in managing EV operations, including charging, discharging, and optimizing their interactions with the grid13. In what follows, the components of the DERs within the framework of EVs charging-discharging and the bidirectional transfer of energy between several parties will be explicited.

In addition, the integration of V2G energy transfer mode aiming to ensure more stability of the microgrid will be surveyed based on sevral previous studies on the topic. Note here that this section aims to critically investigate recent literature review in order to well-situate the contributions of our paper as compared to previous studies. This litertaure review will end by providing a comprehensive summary of the findings of selected studies while emphasising on the novelties of our study.\n\nRole of aggregators in EV energy management\n\nAggregators act as intermediaries between EV users and the energy market, facilitating optimal energy dispatch strategies. According to research published in the European Platform of Legal Frameworks14, EV aggregation networks enable market participation by connecting individual EV owners with central energy providers. This role is essential in mitigating the unpredictable nature of EV charging patterns, improving grid stability, and ensuring efficient energy utilization15. However, existing literature lacks a unified strategy for optimizing EV aggregator participation in energy markets under uncertainty, highlighting the need for improved decision-making frameworks.\n\nOptimization techniques for EV aggregation\n\nSeveral optimization strategies have been proposed to enhance EV aggregation decision-making under uncertainty. These methodologies can be broadly classified into stochastic and deterministic approaches.\n\nStochastic Optimization: Stochastic methods consider uncertainties in EV availability and charging behavior by modeling multiple probable outcomes. Scenario-based techniques estimate power requirements by evaluating various scenarios16. However, these methods require a high computational burden due to the extensive number of trials necessary to assess large-scale EV fleets17.\n\nDeterministic Approaches: Deterministic models predict energy consumption and available charging times for individual EVs, assuming known driving patterns. While these models offer precise decision-making, they often fail to account for real-world uncertainties18. Some studies introduce risk-averse techniques, such as chance constraints19 or conditional value-at-risk methods20, to enhance robustness. However, these approaches often lack adaptability to worst-case scenarios, such as extreme fluctuations in EV participation21.\n\nTo mitigate computational challenges, researchers have developed scenario-reduction techniques that balance complexity and solution optimality. These methods streamline calculations by prioritizing key scenarios without significantly compromising accuracy22.\n\nConsideration of stakeholders in EV optimization\n\nTo further improve energy management, recent studies integrate the perspectives of multiple stakeholders, including EV owners, aggregators, and distribution system operators (DSOs). For instance, the research in23 proposes a multi-objective framework that balances cost minimization for EV owners while reducing power losses and enhancing system efficiency for DSOs. By applying this methodology to an IEEE 69-bus test feeder with real-world load data, the study demonstrates its effectiveness in optimizing charging schedules and minimizing operational expenses.\n\nAdvanced control and machine learning techniques in energy management\n\nBeyond traditional optimization techniques, recent advancements integrate artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) to enhance decision-making in energy management systems:\n\nFuzzy cloud stochastic models optimize energy distribution and storage efficiency by considering multi-objective constraints, such as emissions and cost reduction24.\n\nIntelligent Energy Management Systems (EMS) segment daily energy demand into smaller intervals, reducing voltage fluctuations and network losses25.\n\nFuzzy logic-based EV selection models prioritize cost-efficiency while minimizing battery degradation, ensuring long-term sustainability26.\n\nMachine learning algorithms, including Gaussian Process modeling and Krill Herd Algorithm, provide accurate predictions of HEV charging demand, reducing prediction errors and operational costs27.\n\nHybrid control strategies such as Fuzzy PID controllers, Grey Wolf Optimization, and Random Forest techniques dynamically adjust EV charging schedules, optimizing efficiency in uncertain environments28,29,30.\n\nEnhancing microgrid stability through V2G integration\n\nThe integration of vehicle-to-grid (V2G) technology strengthens microgrid stability by enabling EVs to function as distributed energy reserves. V2G strategies improve grid efficiency by reducing congestion and balancing supply-demand dynamics in real time31. Stochastic optimization approaches, including Coati Optimization and Iterative Map-Based Self-Adaptive Crystal Structure Algorithm, have demonstrated effectiveness in managing unpredictable EV charging behaviors32. Additionally, ML-based predictive models further refine energy distribution strategies, ensuring optimized grid performance33.\n\nIdentified research gaps and contribution of the proposed study\n\nDespite significant advancements in EV aggregation and energy management strategies, several gaps remain:\n\nComputational Scalability and Robustness: Existing stochastic and deterministic optimization techniques struggle with handling large-scale networks and managing the uncertainties of EV behaviors efficiently.\n\nLack of Integrated AI-Based Methods: Limited integration of AI-based techniques with conventional energy management frameworks for real-time decision-making.\n\nStakeholder-Specific Multi-Objective Frameworks: Current studies lack a comprehensive framework that simultaneously considers aggregator profitability, EV user satisfaction, and grid stability.\n\nV2G and Drone-Assisted Data Exchange: The absence of an integrated approach combining V2G capabilities with aggregator-based optimization for enhanced grid stability, particularly using drone-assisted real-time data exchange.\n\nThe State-of-the-Art Comparison Table 1 provides a structured overview of various optimization methodologies used for EV energy management, comparing their key findings and limitations. It highlights advancements in AI-based, stochastic, and hybrid optimization techniques for grid stability, cost efficiency, and energy management. The reviewed studies demonstrate the effectiveness of various optimization techniques but also reveal critical gaps, particularly in addressing scalability, real-time adaptability, and the integration of emerging technologies. Building on these insights, the next section formulates the optimization problem, outlining the objectives and constraints that guide the proposed framework.\n\nProblem formulation\n\nEVs, equipped with vehicle-to-grid (V2G) technology, have the potential to consume and send energy back to the grid. This bidirectional capability, coupled with aggregator models and unmanned aerial systems (UASs) commonly known as drones serving as enablers for the EV charging efficient operation, can revolutionize energy management, grid stability, and remote monitoring. Furthermore, drone-based sensors and communication tools facilitate real-time data collection and monitoring, especially in remote areas where traditional infrastructure is limited. In fact, drones may play a key role in centralizing the data collected from various stakeholders including the EVs, charging stations, grid operators among others. In addition, they may provide the EVs drivers (or the autonomous EVs) with information about the crowd particularly when they are moving toward the optimal available charging stations. Under these conditions, the gain in term of driving time, battery autonomy, grid stability and charging stations management is ensured.\n\nIn the context of smart grids, Vehicle-to-Grid (V2G) technology plays a crucial role in enhancing grid flexibility, stability, and efficiency. V2G enables bidirectional energy exchange between electric vehicles (EVs) and the power grid, allowing EVs not only to consume electricity but also to supply energy back to the grid when needed. This interaction facilitates several benefits, including load balancing, active and reactive power compensation, and demand-side management. One of the key advantages of V2G is its ability to store excess renewable energy, particularly from intermittent sources like solar and wind, within EV batteries. This stored energy can then be dispatched back to the grid during peak demand periods, improving grid reliability and energy utilization. V2G systems can be categorized into unidirectional (V1G) and bidirectional configurations. Unidirectional V2G supports controlled charging to optimize grid stability, while bidirectional V2G, as employed in our proposed method, allows EVs to function as distributed energy storage units that actively contribute to grid support.\n\nIn our approach, EVs dynamically exchange energy with the grid, assisting in peak load management and renewable energy integration. By enabling EVs to discharge surplus energy during high-demand periods and recharge during low-demand hours, the proposed V2G framework enhances grid resilience, reduces operational costs, and minimizes reliance on conventional power plants. Furthermore, V2G empowers EV owners to participate in demand response programs, providing financial incentives while optimizing grid performance. This strategic energy exchange fosters a more sustainable and intelligent energy ecosystem, supporting the transition toward greener and more efficient power networks.\n\nThe generalization of the V2G architecture is illustrated in Fig. 1. EV charging stations (EVCSs) are engaged in supervising each EV charging point and organize them so that, when aggregated, they possess sufficient generating capacity to significantly impact the power network. The primary role of the EVCS monitoring system is to report on the EVs parked in the respective area by collecting data such as EV’s time of arrival, departure time, the initial SoC, the final SoC etc. to the aggregator in predefined timeframes. This centralized management approach using EVCS enables effective monitoring of a large-scale EV fleet, contributing to load management and grid stability23.\n\nAn EV aggregated by an agent like an aggregator becomes a potential resource to engage in the DR programs, thus the need for an optimization algorithm to handle EV scheduling for better operational stability, improved provision of service and customer satisfaction.\n\nBy aggregating EVs, an aggregator can effectively participate in DR programs, enhancing grid stability and service quality. Optimizing EV charging and discharging schedules through appropriate algorithms is crucial to maximize the benefits for both EV owners and the power grid.\n\nEVCS aggregation scheme with drone-enabled V2G system.\n\nThe residential distribution systems consider the role of an aggregator who plans the optimal EV charging schedule to maximize the cost-benefit ratio. An agreement of fixed monthly fee might be established between the aggregator and the EV owners34. EV owners benefit from lower charging costs made easy by the aggregators. The effectiveness of the distribution mechanism does not affect the aggregator. To optimize charging, the aggregator requires information about the vehicle’s starting SoC, arrival time, and departure time. The results of unplanned operation are compared with those of scheduled charging and discharge35.\n\nOptimal scheduling of EV charging/discharging\n\nThe objective of optimal EV scheduling is to balance the interests of the aggregator and the DSO36. To simplify the investigation, we assume that EVs maintain a constant charging/discharging power equal to their rated capacity throughout each time slot. At the beginning of each time slot, an optimization algorithm is employed to determine the optimal schedule. In this work, the scheduling strategy is evaluated using three EV models with different rated values for a 10-minute time slot37. The optimal scheduling scheme for a time slot ‘t’ is formulated (Eq. 1) from the EV aggregator perspective.\n\nwhere,\n\n\\(\\:{P}_{\\text{m}\\text{a}\\text{x}}\\) maximum charging/discharging power in kW\n\n\\(\\:{\\rho\\:}_{t}\\) charge/discharge rate,\n\n\\(\\:C\\left(t\\right)\\) is the electricity price at time instant ‘t’,\n\n\\(\\:\\left\\{\\text{0,1},-1\\right\\}\\) denotes the idle state, discharging and charging of the EV, respectively.\n\nEnergy available in the battery E(tn) is given by:\n\n\\(\\:E\\left({t}_{0}\\right)\\:\\)is the initial energy of the battery, while the SoC at the \\(\\:{t}_{0}\\) instant is computed as,\n\n\\(\\:SoC\\left({t}_{0}\\right)\\): The State of Charge at time \\(\\:{t}_{0}\\), representing the remaining energy in the battery as a fraction of its maximum capacity.\n\n\\(\\:So{C}_{\\text{m}\\text{a}\\text{x}}\\): The maximum possible \\(\\:SoC\\) (100% or 1.0 in normalized form).\n\n\\(\\:{W}_{\\text{k}}\\): The energy consumed by vehicles for traveling k kilometers.\n\nd: The distance traveled (in kilometers) during the given trip.\n\nk: A normalization factor for distance, representing trip characteristics.\n\n\\(\\:{E}_{\\text{m}\\text{a}\\text{x}}\\): The maximum energy storage capacity of the EV’s battery.\n\nFor simulation purposes, let’s assume the initial energy of the SoC to be 25% of the total rated battery capacity.\n\nThe SoC at the nth instant is given by,\n\nThe duration between \\(\\:{t}_{0}\\) and T is utilized for the scheduling process.\n\nFrom a DSO perspective, the responsibility lies in making sure all network limits are met. To run the network effectively, the goal is to reduce power loss. Thus, the line loss \\(\\:{P}_{Loss,t}\\) of the distribution system at time instant ‘t’ can be expressed as,\n\nsubject to,\n\nWhere,\n\n\\(\\:{P}_{G,t}\\) real power generation at the slack bus at time instant ‘t’\n\n\\(\\:{P}_{{D}_{i,t}}\\) real power load at the ith bus at time instant ‘t’.\n\nWhile, \\(\\:{P}_{{D}_{{k}_{\\text{new\\:}}},t}\\) is the current real power load at kth bus, including the real power demand PDk,t and the charging/discharging EV power at time ‘t’ as represented by Eq. (9)\n\nWhere, \\(\\:{V}_{n}\\) denotes the voltage magnitude at the nth bus. \\(\\:{V}_{\\text{m}\\text{i}\\text{n}}\\) and \\(\\:{V}_{\\text{m}\\text{a}\\text{x}}\\) are the minimum and maximum voltage limits, respectively.\n\nThe aggregator and DSO coordinate their efforts to implement optimal scheduling, ensuring efficient grid operation. This strategy satisfies all the demands and limitations put forth by the aggregator and DSO while minimizing the charging costs faced by EV owners and the power loss in the network38.\n\nConsidering the previous analysis, the final objective function is expressed as a weighted sum of Eq. (1) and Eq. (7) as follows,\n\nWhere \\(\\:{w}_{1}\\) and \\(\\:{w}_{2}\\) are weight factors.\n\nThe linear weighted sum technique was selected for EV scheduling optimization due to its simplicity, flexibility, and practical applicability. It effectively combines multiple conflicting objectives, such as minimizing power losses, improving voltage profiles, and ensuring EV user satisfaction, into a single function by assigning adjustable weights. This method is computationally efficient, avoiding the complexity of maintaining Pareto-optimal solutions, and is well-suited for large-scale problems. Its adaptability allows dynamic weight adjustments to accommodate varying operational conditions, ensuring robustness across diverse scenarios. Comparative analysis confirms its balance of simplicity and performance, making it ideal for the proposed EV scheduling framework.\n\nMeasure of user satisfaction with EV’s SoC\n\nSoC satisfaction measures the extent to which an aggregator can fulfill the charging/discharging needs of an EV user. When EV users participate in the service, facility constraints or operational limitations may lead to discrepancies between predicted and actual charging/discharging SoC, potentially affecting customer satisfaction. To quantify this, we introduce an index, denoted as \\(\\:{G}_{1,i}\\text{\\%}\\), representing the satisfaction of the ith EV with its SoC upon leaving the aggregator34.\n\nwhere \\(\\:SO{C}_{0,i}\\) – arrival time SoC\n\n\\(\\:SO{C}_{i}^{{\\prime\\:}}\\)- targeted SoC value\n\n\\(\\:SO{C}_{i}^{{\\prime\\:}{\\prime\\:}}\\)- SoC value at the ith EV departure time.\n\nWith the problem clearly defined and the key constraints identified, an efficient optimization approach is required to achieve multi-objective scheduling while ensuring grid stability. The following section introduces the Red Deer Algorithm (RDA), detailing its mechanism and its suitability for solving the formulated optimization problem.\n\nRed deer algorithm (RDA)\n\nThe Red Deer Algorithm (RDA)39 is a nature-inspired optimization technique that draws its inspiration from the unique mating behavior of Scottish red deer during the breeding season. These behaviors include roaring, fighting, and harem formation, which are crucial in establishing dominance and ensuring reproductive success. By mimicking these biological processes, the RDA effectively balances exploration and exploitation within the solution space, making it well-suited for solving complex optimization problems. Due to its efficiency, the RDA has been used in EV charging related applications including data clustering40, sensor node clustering in wireless sensor networks41 and path planning of inspection robots42.\n\nConceptually, the operation of the RDA is illustrated in the following phases43:\n\nRoaring phase\n\nIn nature, male red deer roar to assert their presence and attract mates. The algorithm models this behavior as a local search process, where solutions explore their neighborhood to improve their fitness. This phase enhances diversification by encouraging the algorithm to search new regions of the solution space.\n\nFighting phase\n\nMale red deer compete through physical contests to establish dominance. In RDA, this is translated into a selection mechanism where candidate solutions are evaluated and the strongest (best fitness) are promoted as “commanders,” while weaker solutions become “stags.” This ensures intensification by focusing on the most promising areas of the solution space.\n\nHarem formation and mating\n\nDominant male deer form harems by attracting females, which they defend and mate with. In RDA, commanders generate new solutions (offspring) by combining their traits with selected females (other solutions). This phase incorporates both local and global exploration, introducing diversity while refining existing solutions.\n\nMathematical framework\n\nKey steps in the RDA are mathematically formulated as follows43:\n\nInitialization:\n\nThe initial population (Npop) is divided into males (Nmale) and females (hinds, Nhind).\n\nA solution is represented as an array:\n\nWhere (Nvar) is the number of decision variables.\n\nRoaring Phase:\n\nMale red deer explore the solution space by updating their positions:\n\nWhere Ub and Lb are the upper and lower bounds, and a1, a2, a3 are random values in [0,1].\n\nFighting Phase:\n\nCommanders (NCom) and stags (Nstag) compete. Two new solutions are generated:\n\nWhere b1, b2 are random parameters, and the better solution is retained.\n\nHarem Formation\n\nThe power (Pn) of a commander determines the proportion of hinds in the harem:\n\nwhere Vn is the normalized fitness of the n-th commander.\n\nMating Phase:\n\nOffspring are generated by mating within and across harems. The offspring solution is:\n\nwhere c is a random parameter.\n\nExploration and exploitation balance\n\nThe Red Deer Algorithm (RDA) balances exploration, which diversifies the search for potential solutions, and exploitation, which refines the best solutions to achieve optimal results. Exploration is driven by the roaring phase, which introduces variability and prevents premature convergence, while exploitation is reinforced by the fighting and mating phases, emphasizing intensification through competition and hierarchical mating. By dynamically adjusting parameters (a, b, c), the RDA adapts to maintain this balance, ensuring effective navigation of the search space and convergence to high-quality solutions in complex optimization problems.\n\nImplementation of RDA\n\nThe flowchart in Fig. 2 outlines a structured process for optimizing EV charging schedules using RDA. The algorithm begins with inputting grid and EV parameters, setting up an initial EV aggregator configuration, and defining constraints and RDA parameters. The algorithm iteratively updates the aggregator’s location and capacity, computes objective functions (e.g., cost minimization and grid stability), and calculates fitness values. Through power dispatch and optimal schedule determination, the process checks for convergence and outputs the final solutions, ensuring an efficient and balanced EV charging strategy while minimizing costs and impact on the grid.\n\nFlowchart of RDA.\n\nRDA’s breeding process, including the mating of stags with the nearest hind, further enhances exploration. The subsequent generation of RDs through the mating process represents the creation of new solutions, reflecting the evolutionary nature of the algorithm. To maintain diversity and prevent premature convergence, weak solutions are also given a chance to contribute to the next generation.\n\nWhile the Red Deer Algorithm (RDA) provides an effective optimization framework for EV scheduling, the economic aspect of charging costs plays a crucial role in influencing EV user behavior and grid stability. To further enhance the effectiveness of EV integration, the following section explores dynamic electricity pricing strategies, particularly Time-of-Use (ToU) pricing, and their impact on optimizing EV charging demand.\n\nDynamic electricity pricing\n\nElectricity pricing has evolved from traditional flat-rate structures to dynamic pricing models, allowing for more efficient energy distribution and demand-side management. Dynamic electricity pricing adjusts tariffs based on real-time supply and demand conditions, aiming to enhance grid stability and incentivize consumers to shift their energy usage to off-peak hours. Among the various dynamic pricing strategies, Time-of-Use (ToU) pricing remains one of the most widely implemented approaches.\n\nToU pricing system establishes electricity rates based on specific time blocks, determined in advance by utilities using historical data rather than real-time demand44. This pricing model provides different electricity tariffs based on three periods: off-peak, mid-peak, and full-peak. During the off-peak period, electricity supply exceeds demand, leading to lower ToU costs. At mid-peak, supply and demand are nearly balanced, resulting in moderate pricing. However, during full-peak hours, electricity consumption surges, necessitating the operation of expensive and less efficient peaking power plants, such as those using diesel, coal, and petroleum. To handle high peak demand, utilities must also invest in infrastructure expansion and additional power generation facilities.\n\nAs electricity generation increases, technical losses within the system also rise, leading to higher peak rates. To mitigate the impact of EV charging on the grid, utilities often rely on infrastructural variations and indirect pricing mechanisms. However, since ToU pricing features high rates only during peak hours and low rates in off-peak periods, it alone is insufficient to effectively manage the influence of EV charging on the power grid.\n\nIn smart grids, Time-of-Use (ToU) pricing is structured so that electricity rates fluctuate based on the grid’s load at different times of the day. The 24-hour period is divided into multiple time intervals {τ1, τ2, ., τq}, each associated with a corresponding grid load {Lτ1, Lτ2, ., Lτq} and a set of discrete pricing levels {Pτ1, Pτ2, ., Pτq}. These prices are selected from a predefined set of discrete values P = {P1, ., Pn}45.\n\nThe pricing mechanism operates on a global scale, ensuring that electricity rates are directly proportional to the grid’s total demand. When demand reaches its highest peak during a specific time slot τθ, the unit price is set to the maximum value Pτθ = max(Pτ1, Pτ2, …, Pτq). Conversely, when the grid load is at its lowest, the pricing is adjusted to the minimum level Pτθ = min(Pτ1, Pτ2, …, Pτq). This dynamic pricing approach optimizes energy consumption patterns, encouraging users to shift their usage to periods of lower demand, thereby improving grid efficiency and stability.\n\nA grid-specific Time-of-Use (ToU) pricing framework is employed to facilitate the practical application of the proposed pricing strategy, which is systematically outlined in the step-by-step algorithm provided below.\n\nAdaptive Pricing Mechanism for EV Charging45.\n\nThe variable κ represents the capacity of the distribution network, while x=(x0,x1,x2,…,x23) denotes the conventional load of the network over a 24-hour period, measured at hourly intervals. The adjusted load values, denoted as x′, are computed using Eq. (18):\n\nwhere ζ serves as a normalization factor. This transformation standardizes the load values to a new range, facilitating further analysis.\n\nThe function f scales the load vector x within the range [1,−1], using ζ as the upper threshold and 0 as the lower threshold. The parameter ζ is selected to ensure that max(x) ≤ ζ < κ, where κκ represents the distribution network’s capacity.\n\nElectric vehicles (EVs) act as flexible loads that can be integrated into the system during periods of low demand, helping to balance the grid by filling demand valleys and maintaining stable operation. To achieve peak shaving and valley filling, the parameters 1 and δ2 are determined using Eqs. (19) and (20), where max(x′) and min (x′) correspond to the highest and lowest values within the normalized load vector x′.\n\nNext, a convex optimization problem is formulated to minimize \\(g(y^{\\prime}+x^{\\prime}+{\\delta _1}+{\\delta _2})\\) where the decision variable y′ is constrained within the range [− 1,1], ensuring that the additional load from EV charging is properly adjusted.\n\nThe values of δ1and δ2 are added element-wise to x′, resulting in y′, which represents the normalized desired EV charging load. The actual charging load y is obtained by denormalizing y′ using Eq. (21):\n\nOnce the desired valley-filling load y is determined, the charging price is assigned based on a ranking system. The maximum and minimum values of y are set as the upper and lower bounds, respectively. The load values are then distributed across the available discrete pricing levels {Pτ1, Pτ2, …, Pτq}. The highest price is assigned to the lowest load, the second-highest price is assigned to the second-lowest load, and this process continues until the highest load is allocated to the lowest price, ensuring an efficient demand-response pricing structure.\n\nThe integration of dynamic electricity pricing, particularly Time-of-Use (ToU) pricing, plays a crucial role in shaping EV charging behaviors and reducing peak demand. However, the real-world impact of these pricing strategies, combined with the proposed optimization framework, must be evaluated through rigorous simulations. The next section presents simulation results, analyzing the effectiveness of the Red Deer Algorithm (RDA) in optimizing EV scheduling and assessing its impact on power distribution networks.\n\nSimulation results and discussion\n\nA demographic-based analysis was conducted to evaluate spatiotemporal patterns in vehicle utilization and charging behavior. The methodology incorporated three vehicle models, each characterized by distinct specifications in terms of battery capacity, operational range, and charging parameters (Tables 1 and 2). Temporal stratification of charging events revealed three primary intervals: morning peak (06:00–10:00), evening peak (15:00–21:00), and off-peak periods. This temporal categorization was derived from empirical observations of charging behavior and network load distributions9.\n\nThe simulation framework incorporated a State of Charge (SoC) threshold parameter of 25%, established to reflect observed user charging behavior patterns. Power demand characterization was conducted using a high-resolution dataset derived from a 69-bus residential distribution network, incorporating both active (P) and reactive (Q) power measurements. The dataset architecture included hierarchical power demand parameters: aggregate network loading, maximum bus capacity utilization, individual nodal demand profiles, and EV charging power consumption patterns. Temporal granularity was maintained at 10-minute intervals throughout the 24-hour analysis period, facilitating comprehensive evaluation of load dynamics and charging patterns.\n\nAdditionally, four distributed generators (DGs) were incorporated into the test network alongside the EVs. The load power demand data was combined with the vehicle specifications from Tables 2 and 3 to address the scheduling optimization problem. This approach aims to manage the charging and discharging of EVs connected to the network without overloading the distribution system. Furthermore, the approach capitalizes for power losses’ reduction and voltage profile improvement.\n\nAverage EV demand\n\nTemporal analysis of energy demand characteristics is presented in Fig. 3, depicting diurnal consumption patterns for six EV configurations (three international and three domestic models) during weekday operational cycles. The profiles delineate charging initialization parameters and temporal duration metrics, correlated with initial and terminal State of Charge (SOC) values. Model validation was conducted through comparative assessment of simulated demand profiles against empirical charging data obtained from operational EVs. Statistical analysis revealed significant correlation coefficients between simulated and measured charging behaviors, substantiating the accuracy and reliability of the computational framework.\n\nProfiles and average energy demand for EVs’ from (a) International market (b) Indian market.\n\nMore in-depth analysis of Fig. 3a and b reveals that the peak demand for both international (1.53 kW) and Indian (1.49 kW) model profiles occurs during the evening hours (4 PM to 10 PM). Notably, the simulated average peak demand aligns closely with the monitored EV charging behavior, suggesting the effectiveness of the EV scheduling optimization. Additionally, individual EV energy demand remains well-managed, with a maximum of 15 kW.\n\nThe results in Fig. 4 were obtained by simulating three scenarios: (1) households without EVs, (2) households with EVs, and (3) a combination of households and EVs. The simulation considered a 24-hour cycle for a 69-bus network with typical residential load patterns. Key assumptions include:\n\nInitial SoC: Randomized between 20% and 80% for the simulated EV fleet.\n\nCharging Power: Based on rated values of the EV models in Tables 1 and 2.\n\nTime Slots: Ten-minute intervals were used to capture dynamic changes.\n\nConstraints: Network voltage limits are 0.95–1.05 p.u., the transformer capacity falls below 100% utilization, and user satisfaction thresholds is set to SoC greater than 80% upon departure.\n\nScenarios: Unmanaged charging (baseline) and optimal scheduling using the proposed algorithm.\n\nThese conditions and constraints were implemented in MATLAB/Simulink to generate aggregated demand profiles with emphasis on the impact of controlled and uncontrolled EV charging. The average EV demand peaks during peak hours (7 AM to 10 AM, 4 PM to 10 PM), ranging from 1.18 kW to 1.74 kW. Notably, this peak demand for EVs is significantly higher than the household power demands, which typically remain below 0.4 kW during peak hours. The results demonstrate that EV integration significantly impacts network power demand characteristics, necessitating the implementation of charging regulation protocols to mitigate peak load conditions across the distribution infrastructure. Analysis reveals equivalent demand patterns across both vehicle model categories, resulting in identical graphical representations. This uniformity in load profiles underscores the consistent impact of EV charging on network demands, independent of vehicle model specifications.\n\nAverage energy demand for 1000 households, EVs and households plus EVs for EVs from (a) international market (b) Indian market.\n\nEVs scheduling and control\n\nNetwork performance characteristics and charging point operational parameters are illustrated in Figs. 5, 6, 7 and 8, demonstrating temporal variations across a 24-hour cycle within a 69-bus feeder infrastructure. Comparative analysis was conducted between controlled and uncontrolled operational scenarios at 100% EV penetration. Uncontrolled charging scenarios exhibited critical transformer overloading of 136% with substantial voltage profile degradation beyond acceptable operational parameters. The implemented scheduling management protocol demonstrated successful regulation of transformer loading within nominal capacity while maintaining voltage profiles within prescribed operational limits. Empirical results suggest the proposed control methodology enables optimization of network hosting capacity approaching 100% EV penetration thresholds.\n\nEV Transformer loading with and without control for (a) International (b) Indian EVs’ Model.\n\nQuantitative analysis of Fig. 5a, focused on international EV models, reveals that implementation of the control algorithm effectively constrained transformer loading to maximum values of approximately 80 kW during peak demand intervals. Similarly, Fig. 5b analysis, centered on domestic (Indian) EV models, demonstrates that the control protocol successfully maintained peak transformer loading at approximately 100 kW, representing a significant reduction from the uncontrolled scenario’s maximum loading of 350 kW. These results quantify the efficacy of the implemented control strategy in mitigating peak transformer loading conditions across both vehicle categories.\n\nComparison of Voltage Profile with and without control cycle for EVs from (a) International and (b) Indian markets.\n\nAnalysis of Fig. 6a reveals that implementation of the control mechanism for international EV models results in a sustained voltage profile exceeding 0.90 per unit (p.u.) across the test network. In the absence of control measures, significant voltage degradation is observed during peak demand periods (17:00–22:00), with values declining below 0.7 p.u. The comparative analysis between controlled and uncontrolled scenarios demonstrates the control system’s efficacy in maintaining network voltage stability. Similarly, Fig. 6b illustrates the control cycle’s effectiveness for Indian EV models, where voltage levels are consistently maintained above 0.9 p.u. throughout the 24-hour operational period. The quantitative comparison between both scenarios provides empirical evidence of the control system’s capability in preserving voltage stability across different EV model configurations.\n\nComparison of aggregated EV power demand with and without control cycles for (a) international and (b) Indian EVs’ models.\n\nTemporal analysis of aggregate EV demand characteristics in Fig. 7a demonstrates the optimization efficacy of implemented charging point management protocols for International Model EVs. The control algorithm implementation (blue curve) achieved a 46.7% reduction in peak demand, from 15 kVA to 8 kVA, relative to the uncontrolled scenario (dotted red curve). The control methodology demonstrates successful attenuation of demand variability during critical loading periods.\n\nFigure 7b illustrates comparative demand profiles for Indian Model EVs under controlled and uncontrolled operational scenarios. The implementation of the optimization protocol resulted in a 33.3% reduction in peak demand, from 9 kVA to 6 kVA, with significant enhancement of load profile stability. The demonstrated load modulation capabilities suggest robust potential for grid stability maintenance under increased EV penetration conditions, particularly during periods of heightened demand volatility.\n\nIndividual EV Charging Behavior with and Without Control (a) International Model (b) Indian Model,\n\nFigure 8 demonstrates the temporal dynamics of EV charging station connectivity patterns in response to aggregate demand fluctuations. The control protocol implements strategic disconnection during peak demand intervals, with subsequent reconnection and charging resumption during reduced network loading conditions, maintaining this cycle until target State of Charge (SoC) parameters are achieved. Analysis of Fig. 8a reveals that uncontrolled charging of international model EVs exhibits extended charging durations during peak periods, initiating at approximately 16:00 and concluding at 00:30. Implementation of the control strategy demonstrates charging duration reduction exceeding 120 min. Figure 8b exhibits analogous behavioral patterns for domestic (Indian) model EVs.\n\nCustomer impact level (CIL)\n\nThe quantitative assessment of direct scheduling impacts on EV charging station operations employed the Customer Impact Level (CIL) metric, as established in reference36. The metric utilizes a decile classification system (groups 0–9) to quantify the proportional increase in charging duration required to achieve target State of Charge (SoC) under implemented management protocols, relative to uncontrolled charging scenarios.\n\nProbability of CIL for EV Charging Control Actions (a) International Model (b) Indian Model.\n\nFigure 9 presents the distributional analysis of Customer Impact Level (CIL) across varying EV penetration scenarios, where each CIL classification represents a 25% incremental deviation in charging duration from scheduled parameters. At 40% penetration levels, charging disruption analysis reveals minimal impact, with 70% of the EV population experiencing negligible temporal deviation (CIL 0). As penetration levels escalate to 60% and beyond, temporal disruptions demonstrate increased prevalence, affecting approximately 60% of the EV fleet. However, the magnitude of impact remains within manageable parameters, with a minimal proportion of EVs experiencing charging duration extensions exceeding 100% of nominal values, even under peak loading conditions. These results validate the efficacy of the implemented EV scheduling protocol in maintaining network operational efficiency.\n\nAggregated EV Availability with EV Management for EVs from (a) International market (b) Indian market.\n\nAnalysis of V2G capacity characteristics presented in Fig. 10 demonstrates the operational viability of aggregated electric vehicles as distributed energy resources within the grid infrastructure. Under implemented management protocols3, the test network exhibited aggregate EV availability coefficients ranging from 0.10 to 0.20 during peak loading periods. This empirical evidence substantiates the feasibility of V2G-enabled EV fleets serving as supplementary power sources during critical grid operational states, effectively functioning as distributed storage systems capable of providing emergency power support. The demonstrated availability patterns suggest significant potential for integration of V2G resources into grid emergency response protocols.\n\nDynamic pricing for charging EVs\n\nFigure 11 demonstrates the temporal correlation between Time-of-Use (ToU) dynamic pricing mechanisms for EV charging and aggregate residential-commercial load profiles. The pricing algorithm exhibits inverse relationship with demand patterns, characterized by rate minimization during off-peak intervals (08:00–12:00 h) coinciding with reduced demand, and significant rate escalation during peak consumption periods (18:00–22:00 h). Residential load follows a similar pattern, reaching its lowest level at midday and peaking in the evening, which coincides with the highest electricity prices. Commercial load, though generally lower than residential demand, also increases after 10 h, peaking around 20 h. This strong correlation between electricity prices and load demand emphasizes the importance of incentivizing EV charging during off-peak hours, ensuring grid stability and reducing operational costs. Encouraging smart charging strategies and Vehicle-to-Grid (V2G) integration can help flatten the demand curve and prevent grid congestion caused by uncontrolled EV charging during peak periods.\n\nTime-of-Use (ToU) Dynamic Pricing and Load Demand Correlation for EV Charging.\n\nComparison of RDA and PSO\n\nTo validate the convergence and correctness of the proposed Red Deer Algorithm (RDA), a comparative analysis was conducted against the widely used Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm. Figure 12 presents comparative convergence characteristics of both algorithms, illustrating the temporal evolution of fitness values across 100 iterative cycles.\n\nConvergence Comparison of Red Deer Algorithm (RDA) and Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO).\n\nFrom Fig. 12, it is evident that RDA demonstrates a significantly faster convergence rate compared to PSO. The RDA achieves a lower fitness value within the first few iterations, indicating a more efficient search capability in reaching near-optimal solutions. In contrast, PSO exhibits a slower descent and stagnates at a suboptimal solution for a longer period before showing minor improvements later in the iterations.\n\nKey observations from the comparative analysis include:\n\nFaster Convergence of RDA: The RDA algorithm rapidly decreases the fitness value within early iterations, reaching an optimal or near-optimal solution much faster than PSO. The accelerated convergence to optimal or near-optimal solutions, relative to PSO, indicates enhanced exploration-exploitation equilibrium in the search space dynamics.\n\nStability of Converged Solution: RDA demonstrates superior terminal convergence characteristics, achieving stabilization at a lower fitness value threshold compared to PSO. This reduced terminal fitness value validates RDA’s enhanced capability in identifying global optima for complex optimization problems.\n\nPSO Convergence Limitation: PSO algorithm exhibits persistent elevation in fitness values over extended iteration cycles, indicating reduced adaptation efficiency within complex solution spaces. This prolonged maintenance of higher fitness levels suggests compromised search space exploration capabilities, potentially resulting in premature convergence to local optimal solutions rather than global minima.\n\nPerformance Comparison of RDA and PSO: The performance comparison of two optimization methods on the IEEE 69-bus system, PSO and RDA, is shown in this convergence graph. PSO’s goal function begins at a high value and then progressively drops with very slight variations. It takes about 83 iterations to reach a final value and shows a slower rate of convergence than RDA. In contrast, RDA likewise begins at a high value but declines more quickly in the initial iterations. Compared to PSO, it stabilizes earlier and shows a more noticeable improvement in the first 55 iterations.\n\nThese findings confirm the effectiveness of the proposed optimization framework in minimizing power losses, improving voltage stability, and optimizing EV charging schedules. The results further demonstrate that the Red Deer Algorithm (RDA) outperforms Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) in terms of convergence speed and solution quality. The final section provides a summary of key insights, highlights existing limitations, and proposes future research directions to enhance the seamless integration of EVs into smart grid systems.\n\nConclusion\n\nThis study provides a comprehensive analysis of EVs charging practices, their impact on distribution systems, and the effectiveness of the proposed scheduling strategies using Red Deer Algorithm (RDA). Two distinct EV models – selected from International and Indian markets, respectively - differing in battery capacity and range, to ensure a broad applicability of the findings.\n\nThe simulations of hourly energy demand profiles demonstrated strong correlation with actual EV charging behavior, validating the accuracy of our models. Peak demands for both EV types occurred during morning (8 AM to 10 AM) and evening (6 PM to 10 PM) hours, highlighting critical periods for potential network stress.\n\nThe comparison between EV and household power demands underscored the significant increase in network load due to EV charging, particularly during peak hours. This emphasized the need for effective EV charging regulation to mitigate high load demands across distribution networks.\n\nTo address these challenges, an EV scheduling strategy that simultaneously optimizes two objectives: maximizing power and reducing power losses, using the Red Deer Algorithm (RDA) was proposed. This approach demonstrated remarkable effectiveness in maintaining transformer utilization below rated capacity and voltage levels within specified ranges, even under high EV penetration scenarios. Key achievements of our proposed strategy include:\n\nSignificant decrease in power loss, even with a large fleet of EVs connected to the grid simultaneously for charging and discharging operations.\n\nImproved voltage profiles and consistent EV aggregate power.\n\nReduced EV charging times, even during peak hours.\n\nPotential increase in the hosting capacity of distribution networks.\n\nThe Customer Impact Level (CIL) metric revealed that while charging disruptions increase with higher EV penetration levels, the impact remains manageable. This demonstrates the positive influence of our EV scheduling on network efficiency while minimizing disruptions to EV users.\n\nFurthermore, the study highlighted the potential of Vehicle-to-Grid (V2G) technology. With EV management in place, we observed an aggregated EV availability of 10–20% during peak hours, suggesting that V2G-enabled EVs could serve as a valuable supplementary power source during emergency situations.\n\nThe proposed solution proves to be practical and scalable for similar aggregator- Distribution System Operators (DSO) approaches. Additionally, our EV scheduling model allows for quantification of potential network resources to assist in maintaining the equilibrium between demand and generation.\n\nIn conclusion, this research emphasizes the crucial role of intelligent EV charging management in ensuring grid stability and efficiency as EV adoption continues to grow. The proposed scheduling strategies show promise in maximizing network capacity while minimizing disruptions to EV users, paving the way for smoother integration of EVs into existing power distribution systems. These findings provide valuable insights for both EV aggregators and DSOs in optimizing their operations and planning for a future with increased EV penetration.\n\nData availability\n\nThe datasets used and/or analyzed during the current study are available from the corresponding author on reasonable request.\n\nReferences\n\nHajibandeh, N., Ehsan, M., Soleymani, S., Shafie-khah, M. & Catalão, J.

With the rise of big data, traditional evaluation methods face new challenges, requiring innovative approaches.\n\nMethods\n\nThis article reviews the principles, scope, and limitations of traditional public health policy evaluation methods and explores the application of machine learning in evaluating public health policies.

Introduction\n\nPolicy assessment constitutes a vital component of the national governance framework (1). A scientific and accurate assessment of policy impacts is essential for the modernization of the national governance system and its capacity (2). Traditional policy assessment predominantly utilizes data from sources like official statistical yearbooks, publicly accessible questionnaire databases, and field surveys. The main objective of policy assessment is to empirically validate economic theories (3). In contrast, public health policy evaluations often require integrating various data sources, such as epidemiological, healthcare, and socioeconomic data. The diversity and complexity of data involved in public health assessments are more pronounced compared to other policy evaluations. Additionally, due to the sensitive nature of health data, these evaluations must carefully address data privacy and ethical concerns to ensure individual rights and privacy are protected during data usage. With the advent of the digital economy, driven by the rise of the Internet, cloud computing, and artificial intelligence, many biological data and medical records have been digitized. This has introduced new types of data, such as text, image, and audio data, which are typically unstructured, high-dimensional, low in information density, and large in scale, exceeding the capabilities of traditional public health policy evaluation methods (4). Introducing machine learning methods is essential for effectively exploring and managing these data.\n\nMachine learning is an emerging technology that integrates knowledge from diverse fields such as computer science, engineering, and statistics. It is widely utilized in areas including science, technology, and medicine, and is increasingly attracting interest from researchers in the social sciences (5). The advent of machine learning offers a novel approach to public health policy evaluation. By leveraging advanced algorithms and significant computational power, machine learning can extract critical insights from large datasets and develop more precise predictive models, thereby providing more reliable references for public health policy formulation. Currently, machine learning has become widely prevalent in social science research, leading to numerous review articles focusing on machine learning and causal relationships (6). For example, Grimmer (7), Varian (8), Guo et al. (9). Provide brief introductions to the fundamental concepts and logic of causal identification, explore the intersection of machine learning with causal identification, and discuss the potential of integrating machine learning models into causal identification processes. Mullainathan and Spiess (10), Guo and Tao (11) underscore the critical role of machine learning in causal identification within social sciences, while also addressing the novel challenges it introduces. The existing literature primarily explores the relationship between machine learning and causal identification and emphasizes the significance of incorporating machine learning methods for causal identification within the context of big data. This article, however, emphasizes the value of machine learning in public health policy effect evaluation. Related literature includes research by Shen et al. (12), who compare traditional policy evaluation methods such as the difference-in-differences method, synthetic control method, and panel data method with machine learning approaches, offering empirical researchers a guide for method selection. Nevertheless, this article differs significantly: Shen et al. (13) primarily introduce traditional and machine learning-based policy evaluation methods, conducting a detailed comparison for methodological selection. In contrast, this article delves into the limitations of traditional public health policy evaluation methods within the context of big data and provides a comprehensive exploration of expanding public health policy evaluation boundaries using machine learning methods. Unlike Shen et al.’s straightforward comparison, this article presents a more thorough and detailed examination of machine learning’s application in public health policy evaluation.\n\nThis study aims to address the following key question: How can machine learning techniques improve the evaluation of public health policies in the era of big data, and what challenges and solutions are associated with their application? Hence, the primary contributions of this paper are twofold: first, it outlines the challenges encountered by traditional public health policy effect assessment methods in the context of big data and highlights the advantages and significant value of machine learning in this field. It also offers new insights for scholars seeking to expand the applicability of public health policy effect assessment. Second, the article addresses the limitations of machine learning in public health policy effect assessment and suggests potential directions and efforts for the further development of public health policy assessment and machine learning. The structure of the remaining sections in this article is as follows: Section 2 introduces traditional methods of public health policy impact assessment and examines their challenges in the context of big data. Section 3 highlights the advantages and substantial value of machine learning in public health policy impact assessment within the realm of big data. Section 4 discusses the limitations of machine learning in public health policy impact assessment and proposes future directions. Finally, Section 5 provides a comprehensive summary of the entire paper.\n\n2. Traditional methods of public health policy impact assessment and their existing issues\n\n2.1. Traditional methods of public health policy assessment\n\nThe field of econometrics has developed several traditional methods for quantitatively analyzing public health policy effectiveness. Key among these are the difference-in-differences (DID), synthetic control method (SCM), and regression discontinuity design (RDD), which have gained prominence in academia and are extensively used across various public health policy domains. This section examines the principles, applicability, specific model configurations, and potential challenges related to these conventional public health policy evaluation methods.\n\nThe difference-in-differences (DID) method, originally introduced by Card et al. in their study of minimum wage policy, has been widely adapted for use in public health policy evaluation (14). This method assesses the effects of public health interventions by comparing the differences in outcomes between treatment and control groups before and after a policy is implemented. The first step involves calculating the difference in health outcomes for individuals before and after the policy intervention, which helps control for individual fixed effects (unchanging characteristics specific to each individual). The second step takes a secondary difference, focusing on time-based differentiation across the treatment and control groups, which aims to eliminate time fixed effects (common factors that remain consistent over time). This approach is particularly valuable in public health when policies are tested in certain regions or populations before being rolled out more broadly. It provides a robust way to assess the impact of interventions by controlling for both individual and time-specific effects. However, public health policies implemented simultaneously across all regions may not be well-suited for the DID method. Generally, the model specification for DID in public health policy evaluation follows this structure:\n\nIn Equation (1), subscript denotes the sample and denotes time. represents the dependent variable, indicating the outcome for sample at time . is a dummy variable indicating whether the sample is subject to the public health policy intervention, assigned 1 if affected by the policy, otherwise 0. is a dummy variable for the policy implementation time point, 0 before and 1 after implementation. The term represents the interaction term in the difference-in-differences method, used to identify policy effects. If , the policy increased ; if , it decreased . is the matrix of control variables, including factors affecting the dependent variable. and are individual and time fixed effects, respectively. represents the random disturbance term.\n\nFigure 1 demonstrates the application of the Difference-in-Differences (DID) methodology in evaluating public health policy interventions. It highlights changes in outcome variables, such as health expenditures and mortality rates, between treatment and control groups before and after the intervention. The observed parallel trends in the pre-intervention period confirm the validity of the DID approach, while the divergence in outcomes post-intervention quantifies the policy’s causal impact. By incorporating machine learning into this framework, the study enhances policy evaluation by capturing complex, non-linear relationships and systemic factors, such as hospital ownership. This integration establishes a robust empirical foundation for analyzing public health outcomes and assessing policy effects.\n\nDifference-in-differences (DID) method.\n\nThe double-difference method may encounter challenges related to the parallel trend assumption and selection bias in evaluating public health policy effects. This method relies on the parallel trend assumption, which posits that the health trends of the treatment and control groups are parallel before and after the implementation of public health policies. However, fulfilling this assumption is often difficult in real-world evaluations, particularly when external health interventions or uncontrollable factors, such as epidemics, influence the policy implementation. If the parallel trend assumption is violated, it can result in significant bias in estimating policy effects, thereby compromising the accuracy and reliability of public health assessments. Additionally, the double-difference method is susceptible to selection bias. If, following the implementation of a public health policy, the differences between the treatment and control groups arise not only from the policy effects but are also influenced by other health-related factors (e.g., health infrastructure, access to medical services), the double-difference method may not accurately assess the actual effects of the policy, leading to distorted evaluation results.\n\nIn the context of big data and machine learning, the Difference-in-Differences (DID) method can be improved by incorporating machine learning algorithms, such as propensity score matching (PSM) or random forests, to construct balanced treatment and control groups that more effectively satisfy the parallel trends assumption. For instance, machine learning models can analyze high-dimensional datasets to identify key covariates influencing treatment assignment, thereby enhancing the robustness of DID analysis. Additionally, DID can be adapted to process unstructured data, such as social media health posts or electronic medical records, by employing natural language processing (NLP) or image recognition techniques, expanding its applicability in public health contexts.\n\nThe synthetic control method (SCM) extends the double-difference method by serving as a counterfactual for the treatment group. In evaluating the effects of public health policies, it is often challenging to identify an optimal control group that closely matches the treatment group in all relevant aspects. SCM, based on the counterfactual estimation framework, offers a viable solution. The core idea is that, although it is difficult to find ideal control samples identical to the subjects undergoing policy intervention, a control group can be constructed by linearly combining weights from a pool of potential control groups. This synthetic control group can mirror the characteristics of the treatment group prior to policy implementation, ensuring that the predictor variables align with those of the treated sample. Consequently, it allows for a comparison of changes in health variables between the “real treatment group” and the “synthetic control group” before and after policy implementation, ultimately revealing the net effect of the public health policy (15). This approach is particularly suitable for public health policies with few pilot programs, as they may be tested in only one or two regions, making it difficult to find exact matches elsewhere. Thus, constructing a synthetic counterfactual reference group through an appropriate linear combination of non-pilot districts becomes essential. Typically, the synthetic control method follows four key steps:\n\nFirstly, the model specification assumes an experimental group where the public health policy is implemented, and multiple control groups where the public health policy is not implemented. For each sample i and time t, the model is represented as follows:\n\nIn Equation (2), Subscript denotes the sample and denotes time. is the dependent variable, representing the outcome for sample at time . is a dummy variable indicating public health policy implementation, assigned 1 if the policy is implemented for sample , and 0 otherwise. represents the matrix of control variables, including factors affecting the dependent variable. and denote individual and time fixed effects, respectively. represents the random disturbance term.\n\nSecondly, the synthetic control group is constructed for each sample where the public health policy is not implemented, by weighting and averaging observed data from other control group samples.\n\nIn Equation (3), denotes the predicted value of the synthetic control group; represents the number of reference samples used to construct the synthetic control group; represents the weights computed for each reference sample .\n\nThirdly, synthetic weights are determined by minimizing the differences observed between the experimental group and the synthetic control group before public health policy implementation.\n\nIn Equation (4), and denote the time points before and after public health policy implementation, respectively.\n\nFourthly, as shown in Equation (5), public health policy effects are estimated by comparing the observed values of the experimental group with the predicted values of the synthetic control group.\n\nFigure 2 demonstrates the application of the synthetic control method (SCM) in the context of public policy evaluation. The x-axis represents the time period, while the y-axis indicates the outcome variable of health. The solid line depicts the actual observations for the treated unit, whereas the dashed line represents the estimated counterfactual outcomes generated by the synthetic control group. Before the intervention, marked by a vertical line, the treated unit and the synthetic control group exhibit a similar trajectory, confirming that the SCM effectively approximates the pre-intervention trend of the treated unit. After the intervention, a noticeable divergence between the two lines emerges, reflecting the treatment effect. This gap quantifies the impact of the intervention on the treated unit, assuming the synthetic control group serves as a valid counterfactual.\n\nSynthetic control method.\n\nThe synthetic control method may encounter selection bias in public health policy evaluation due to synthetic portfolio construction. This method necessitates the creation of a synthetic portfolio to simulate the post-policy implementation scenario for comparison with the actual treatment group. However, the selection process may be influenced by the researcher’s subjective preferences and methodological choices, leading to biased outcomes. For instance, a researcher might favor synthetic combinations that demonstrate more favorable effects post-implementation or might rely on specific techniques or models while overlooking alternative methods that could be more suitable. Such subjective and technical decisions can yield synthetic combinations that do not accurately reflect the actual context and compromise the validity and reliability of the policy assessment. Furthermore, public health policies typically target unique intervention objectives and specific populations, making it challenging to identify an appropriate control group. This limitation further diminishes the objectivity and accuracy of the evaluation results. Consequently, the validity and applicability of the synthetic control method in public health policy evaluation are subject to significant constraints.\n\nIn the era of big data, machine learning algorithms, such as k-means clustering and neural networks, can automate the selection of control units, thereby minimizing subjectivity in the construction of synthetic portfolios. These algorithms detect patterns and similarities in large-scale datasets, facilitating the creation of more representative synthetic control groups. For instance, when evaluating a public health policy targeting specific regions, unsupervised learning techniques can group similar regions based on health indicators, socioeconomic variables, and other high-dimensional features, thereby enhancing the accuracy and credibility of synthetic control method (SCM) applications in public health.\n\nThe regression discontinuity design (RDD) was initially proposed by Thistlewaite and Campbell (16), but it gained widespread attention and application in 2001 following Hahn et al.’s formal proof (17). Currently, RDD is extensively used by social science researchers to evaluate public health policies in non-experimental settings (18). The core idea is that when individual characteristics of a subgroup cross a specific policy threshold, the policy induces a discontinuity in the outcome variable. Near the discontinuous policy threshold, groups on both sides form “comparable” experimental and control groups. Given the similarity of these groups, any disparities in the outcome variable are solely attributable to the policy intervention. The breakpoint regression model is ideal for “one-size-fits-all” policies that necessitate explicit policy thresholds, where entities must surpass (or fall below) these thresholds to fall under the policy’s purview. Typically, breakpoint regression models are structured as follows:\n\nIn Equation (6), subscript denotes the sample and denotes time. is the dependent variable indicating the outcome for sample at time . represents the continuous variable related to the public health policy observed for individual at time . denotes the public health policy threshold location. is an indicator variable, equaling 1 when exceeds and 0 otherwise. is the coefficient of , reflecting the slope near the public health policy threshold. is the coefficient of , indicating the public health policy effect on the outcome variable. represents the coefficient of the interaction term capturing the discontinuity effect due to the public health policy. is a matrix of control variables affecting the dependent variable. and denote individual and time fixed effects, respectively. represents the random disturbance term.\n\nFigure 3 demonstrates the central concept of regression discontinuity design (RDD) by depicting the relationship between the running variable (x-axis) and the outcome variable (y-axis). The graph features two fitted lines, each representing observations on either side of the threshold, marked by a vertical dashed line. The left segment corresponds to the control group, while the right segment represents the treatment group. At the threshold, the discontinuity, or “jump,” in the outcome variable indicates the causal effect of the treatment, provided the model’s validity conditions are satisfied. The curvature in the fitted lines reflects non-linear relationships in the data, which are addressed through the chosen modeling strategy, such as higher-order polynomials or machine learning algorithms.\n\nRegression discontinuity design (RDD).\n\nRegression discontinuity design may suffer from breakpoint selection bias in public health policy evaluation. The core of this model relies on a predetermined breakpoint to distinguish between treatment and control groups. However, the selection of breakpoints can be influenced by the researcher’s subjective preferences or external factors, leading to inappropriate or inaccurate choices. In public health policy, breakpoints may be unclear and challenging to define. If a researcher arbitrarily selects a breakpoint without adequate justification, it can result in significant bias in the assessment results, thereby affecting the accurate evaluation and interpretation of policy effects. For instance, a researcher might search for the most optimal breakpoints in the data or choose different breakpoints before and after the implementation of the policy to obtain more favorable results. Such subjectivity and flexibility in breakpoint selection may compromise the objectivity and credibility of the assessment outcomes. Additionally, regression discontinuity design relies on the uniform distribution of the sample on both sides of the cutoff point. If the sample size is insufficient or if there is systematic selection bias on either side of the cutoff, the reliability of the assessment results may be further weakened.\n\nIn the context of big data and machine learning, Regression Discontinuity Design (RDD) can be enhanced by leveraging algorithms such as gradient boosting or support vector machines to identify breakpoints more objectively. These methods analyze high-dimensional datasets to detect natural thresholds or discontinuities in the data, thereby reducing reliance on arbitrary or subjective breakpoint selection. Additionally, RDD can be extended to fuzzy designs using machine learning techniques to predict treatment probabilities when treatment assignment is not perfectly determined by the threshold. For example, in a vaccination program study, machine learning models can estimate individual-level probabilities of receiving treatment near the threshold, thereby enhancing the robustness of RDD analysis.\n\n2.2. The problems of traditional public health policy assessment methods in the context of big data\n\nThe information technology revolution, driven by the Internet, cloud computing, and artificial intelligence, has facilitated the widespread adoption of digital technology in public health. Many aspects of human health behavior and medical activities are now digitally recorded, resulting in vast amounts of new data that encompass dynamic information on individual health status and healthcare service usage. These data are interrelated in complex ways (19), and traditional public health policy evaluation methods are often insufficient for processing and analyzing such complex datasets (20).\n\nUnstructured data in the era of big data presents new challenges for public health policy evaluation. Traditional assessments primarily rely on structured data, such as health statistics yearbooks, medical record databases, or field surveys, which have clear formats and fixed fields, making them easier to analyze and model. However, with the rapid advancement of computer information technologies like the Internet, cloud computing, and artificial intelligence, unprecedented and diverse data types—such as text, images, and audio—are now available, posing challenges for traditional public health evaluations (21). Big data is characterized by unstructured formats, high dimensionality, and low information density (22), creating complexity for traditional evaluation methods. Unstructured data, including electronic medical records, health monitoring data, and social media health information, differs from structured data in its flexibility and diversity. Traditional methods are ill-equipped to extract and analyze such data. High dimensionality involves numerous features and attributes, such as individual health behaviors and environmental factors, exceeding the capacity of traditional tools. Moreover, big data’s low information density requires sophisticated techniques to extract meaningful insights, making manual analysis insufficient for processing high-noise data. Additionally, the sheer volume of big data poses significant challenges in terms of storage, transmission, and processing (23). Public health policy evaluation often necessitates the integration of data from multiple domains, such as medical, social, and environmental sources. This may involve merging multiple large databases, which traditional computing methods handle inefficiently. Thus, advanced technologies like parallel computing and distributed storage are essential for efficiently processing large-scale data and ensuring the accuracy and timeliness of public health policy evaluations.\n\nQuantitative empirical research on public health policy assessment can be categorized into two types: theory-driven and data-driven approaches. Theory-driven research, which traditionally dominates this field, constructs low-dimensional parametric models based on public health theories. However, these theories are often derived from mathematical models built on numerous assumptions, aiming to simplify and abstract complex health systems. This method focuses on identifying causal relationships between key health indicators and policy interventions to reveal the intrinsic effects of policies on health outcomes. The advantages of the theory-driven approach lie in its model simplicity, ease of understanding, and straightforward result interpretation. In macroeconomics, the Lucas Critique illustrates how dynamic, theory-driven models integrate rational expectations to improve predictions of policy impacts, thereby avoiding the limitations of purely data-driven models. Similarly, in psychology, cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) utilizes behavioral theories to explain the interaction between cognitive distortions and behavioral outcomes, offering a structured and interpretable framework for clinical interventions. These examples highlight the strength of theory-driven approaches in promoting deeper understanding and more effective application of models. However, its limitations stem from reliance on a priori knowledge and theoretical assumptions. Model construction depends on the researcher’s prior understanding of the health problem and domain knowledge, making it difficult to handle complex big data. This approach may overlook the intricate relationships and nonlinear patterns present in large datasets. Consequently, theory-driven models may struggle to capture deeper insights in high-dimensional health data, leading to potential model misspecification and impeding accurate public health policy evaluation (4).\n\nIn the era of big data, public health datasets contain numerous variables, resulting in high-dimensional data. This increase in dimensionality amplifies the correlation between variables, heightening the risk of multicollinearity, which threatens both the accuracy and interpretability of models (24). Multicollinearity arises from the interrelationships between health-related variables within large datasets. Big data encompasses vast and complex information across multiple domains, including individual health status, socioeconomic factors, and environmental conditions. Traditional methods for evaluating public health policies struggle to identify correlations among variables within such large-scale data, potentially leading to multicollinearity. This complicates the accurate estimation of independent contributions from variables in traditional models, resulting in unstable and unreliable coefficient estimates, which can even lead to incorrect evaluations of public health policies, ultimately undermining the scientific rigor and effectiveness of policy decisions.\n\nTraditional models for assessing the effects of public health policies typically involve low-dimensional explanatory variables and unknown parameters. Researchers primarily focus on consistently estimating these unknown parameters and assessing the statistical significance of their estimates using the t-statistic or p-value, thus inferring their actual impact on health outcomes. For instance, when the t-statistic exceeds its critical value, researchers may reject the null hypothesis (commonly the hypothesis that the parameter equals zero) in favor of the alternative hypothesis, concluding that the parameter estimate is statistically significant and has a meaningful impact on public health. However, in the context of big data, large sample sizes often result in parameter estimates closely aligning with true values or their probability limits, accompanied by small standard errors. Consequently, even when true parameter values are near zero and their actual impact on health outcomes is minimal, the t-values may still achieve statistical significance, raising concerns about overfitting. Therefore, while the distinction between statistical significance and actual significance of public health effects is less critical with smaller data volumes, it becomes essential to differentiate between the two in big data contexts (4). Otherwise, a parameter deemed statistically significant may not possess sufficient actual impact on public health to support substantive policy conclusions.\n\n3. The advantages of machine learning in public health policy impact assessment\n\nBig data, characterized by unstructured formats, high dimensionality, low information density, and large volumes, poses significant challenges for traditional public health policy evaluation methods. Issues such as model misspecification, multicollinearity, and overfitting are increasingly prominent in this context. Machine learning offers a solution to these challenges by flexibly handling large-scale, high-dimensional health data, uncovering hidden associations, identifying nonlinear relationships, and reducing dependence on a priori knowledge through automatic feature extraction.\n\n3.1. Addressing challenges of unstructured data and massive volume\n\nIn the era of big data, machine learning offers a flexible and adaptive tool to address the challenges posed by unstructured data in public health policy evaluation. Machine learning is particularly effective in handling unstructured, high-dimensional, and low-information-density data. For unstructured health data, such as text, images, and audio from sources like consultation records and medical imaging, machine learning—particularly deep learning models—leverages its capability to process unstructured information. These models comprehensively analyze textual health content, recognize patterns in medical images, and interpret audio data, thereby extracting diverse health-related insights and aiding in the deeper analysis of public health policy effects (25). Machine learning algorithms also manage high-dimensional health data by utilizing techniques like feature selection and dimensionality reduction, enabling automatic identification of key features linked to policy effects and alleviating the burden of dimensionality on traditional methods (26). Additionally, machine learning excels at extracting valuable information from noisy health data, where traditional methods struggle, improving both the efficiency and accuracy of data analysis. Furthermore, machine learning addresses the challenges of storing, transmitting, and processing large-scale health data using advanced technologies such as parallel computing and distributed storage. Parallel computing allows for the simultaneous execution of multiple tasks, boosting computational efficiency, while distributed storage enables the decentralized management of large datasets across multiple nodes, enhancing data access speed and overall processing capacity. These technologies make machine learning models more efficient in handling large-scale health data, meeting the real-time and precision demands of public health policy evaluation. In summary, machine learning algorithms provide a comprehensive approach to extracting and analyzing big health data, offering policymakers more accurate and reliable assessments of public health policy effects.\n\n3.2. Addressing issues in traditional public health policy evaluation models\n\nMachine learning mitigates the risk of model mis-specification in public health policy evaluation through a data-driven approach. Traditional modeling often relies on specific theoretical frameworks that may simplify actual conditions. As a result, it typically employs linear models, such as linear regression, which assume a linear relationship between variables. However, these assumptions may be overly simplistic and fail to accurately capture the potential nonlinearities and interactions among variables when applied to complex public health phenomena in the context of big data and heterogeneity. Furthermore, manually incorporating these relationships can lead to model mis-specification, biasing the estimated parameters. In contrast, machine learning algorithms, such as decision trees and support vector machines, effectively capture nonlinear relationships without the risk of biased estimates resulting from model mis-specification (27, 28). Additionally, ensemble algorithms in machine learning, such as Super Learner, Bayesian Stacked Regression Trees, and Deep Learning, are designed to optimize model specification. These algorithms utilize foundational models trained independently on the same samples, leveraging relatively weak learning models and subsequently integrating their results for improved generalization. By evaluating the strengths of each model, ensemble algorithms aim to identify the optimal model, thereby significantly reducing the risk of mis-specification. This approach provides researchers with more flexible and adaptable tools for understanding and interpreting patterns and associations in large-scale health data, ultimately enhancing the accuracy and reliability of public health policy effect assessments.\n\nDimensionality reduction in high-dimensional models is an effective strategy for addressing multicollinearity issues in the assessment of public health policy effects. Reducing the number of variables in the model decreases correlations between them, thereby improving the stability and interpretability of the model. The primary objective of dimensionality reduction in high-dimensional models is to preserve essential information while eliminating redundant dimensions, aiming for a more concise and interpretable model. Common dimensionality reduction methods include Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Singular Value Decomposition (SVD), and other techniques. These methods transform the original explanatory variables through linear transformations to produce a new set of variables known as principal components. These principal components are linear combinations of the original variables designed to preserve as much variance from the original data as possible. Selecting a subset of principal components enables dimensionality reduction of the original high-dimensional data, thereby reducing the number of explanatory variables in the model and mitigating multicollinearity issues. Multicollinearity arises from high correlations between variables, and principal components are typically constructed by identifying directions of maximum variance, making them orthogonal to each other. This orthogonality implies that correlations between variables are significantly reduced in the space of principal components, thereby mitigating the impact of multicollinearity (29). Selecting principal components allows us to focus on the most representative directions in the public health data, condensing the information of the original data into fewer dimensions. This approach captures the essential characteristics of the data more effectively. However, it is crucial to carefully select the number of principal components to retain during dimensionality reduction. Choosing too few components may lead to loss of important information, while selecting too many may not effectively reduce dimensionality. A common method is to determine the number of principal components based on the cumulative contribution of explained variance (30). Typically, the number of principal components chosen achieves a cumulative contribution rate above a certain threshold, ensuring sufficient information retention while reducing dimensionality.\n\nRegularization mitigates model complexity by introducing a penalty term into the model’s loss function of the public health policy effects assessment model, thereby preventing overfitting to the training data and enhancing its generalization ability on unseen data. The central concept of regularization is to balance the model’s fit and complexity to avoid overfitting. The most commonly used regularization methods are L1 regularization (Lasso) and L2 regularization (Ridge) (31). L1 regularization sparsifies the model by incorporating the L1 norm of the parameter vectors into the loss function. This approach drives some model coefficients to zero, thereby reducing the impact of less important features. Conversely, L2 regularization encourages smaller coefficient values by adding the L2 norm of the parameter vectors to the loss function. This effectively controls the model’s weight size and mitigates overfitting to noise. Additionally, regularization is manifested through the penalty term in the model. This term modifies the model’s loss function to ensure that the model not only fits the training data well but also keeps its parameters within a reasonable range. Consequently, the model emphasizes capturing the essential patterns in the public health data while minimizing overfitting to noise. The strength of regularization is controlled by a tuning parameter, which, when adjusted, helps strike a balance between model complexity and fit.\n\n4. Applying machine learning for public health policy evaluation\n\n4.1. Application steps\n\nMachine learning has emerged as a powerful tool for evaluating policy effectiveness in the context of big data, addressing limitations associated with traditional methods. Using text data as an illustrative example, this article explores the application of machine learning in policy evaluation, focusing on critical steps such as data preparation and cleaning, model selection, training and tuning, model interpretation, and result analysis. The objective is to assist researchers in effectively utilizing this advanced methodology.\n\nThe process of preparing and cleaning data for machine learning begins with text data mining. Natural language processing (NLP) techniques, such as word vectors and bag-of-words models, are employed to analyze text structure and semantics, extracting key information to generate meaningful features for subsequent processing. The next step addresses missing and outlier data through techniques like random forests and k-nearest neighbors for predicting and imputing missing values. Outlier detection methods, including isolation forests and One-Class SVM, are applied to identify and manage anomalies, thereby enhancing data quality. Data smoothing and transformation follow, utilizing approaches like moving averages and exponential smoothing to stabilize time series data, reduce noise, and improve interpretability. Subsequently, feature engineering techniques, such as principal component analysis (PCA) and feature selection methods (e.g., variance thresholding), are employed to extract critical features, optimizing model inputs and improving generalization. The final step standardizes and normalizes data using techniques such as Z-score standardization and MinMax normalization, ensuring consistent feature scales to mitigate bias and provide stable inputs for model training.\n\nAfter data processing and cleaning, the next critical step is model selection, training, and tuning, which significantly impacts model performance. The initial phase involves selecting candidate models, such as decision trees, support vector machines, random forests, linear regression, logistic regression, k-nearest neighbors, naïve Bayes, and neural networks, to encompass diverse modeling approaches. Unlike traditional methods, this process integrates data-driven strategies with domain expertise and policy theories, fostering the development of interpretable and credible models. Model training and hyperparameter tuning then proceed, using cross-validation techniques like k-fold cross-validation to partition the dataset into training and validation sets. Techniques such as grid search, random search, Bayesian optimization, genetic algorithms, gradient boosting, and automated machine learning (AutoML) are employed to identify optimal hyperparameter configurations, guided by policy considerations. These configurations are selected based on validation set performance. Subsequently, model comparison and selection evaluate metrics like accuracy, precision, F1 score, AUC-ROC curves, and confusion matrices to identify the best-performing model. This evaluation integrates domain knowledge, ensuring alignment with broader policy objectives. Finally, ensemble learning techniques, including voting classifiers, stacked models, random forests, gradient boosting trees, and deep learning ensembles, are employed to enhance generalization capabilities. The finalized model is validated using an independent test set to ensure robust performance on unseen data. The models available for each step are shown in Table 1.\n\nModels available for model selection, training and tuning.\n\nAfter the processes of model selection, training, and tuning, it is essential to interpret the final model and its outcomes using robust methodological tools. Local interpretability analysis, for instance, employs techniques like Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations (LIME). LIME constructs interpretable surrogate models for specific samples, allowing researchers to identify key factors—such as vaccination rates, hospital accessibility, or community outreach programs—that significantly influence the classification of public health interventions as “effective” or “ineffective.” This approach facilitates a nuanced understanding of decision-making in individual cases, such as assessing the effectiveness of a vaccination campaign in a particular region.\n\nGlobal interpretability analysis utilizes Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP) values to quantify the contribution of each feature across the entire dataset. In evaluating public health policies, SHAP values provide insights into how variables such as healthcare expenditure, population density, and disease prevalence influence model predictions. For example, a SHAP summary plot might demonstrate that higher healthcare expenditure consistently correlates with improved health outcomes, whereas the impact of population density varies depending on regional infrastructure.\n\nTo complement these analyses, causal model visualization is used to illustrate the pathways and interactions between policy interventions and health outcomes. Directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) enable researchers to explicitly map the relationships between public health interventions, such as mask mandates or quarantine measures, and their effects on outcomes like infection rates or mortality. For instance, a DAG might show how increasing testing capacity reduces disease transmission through early detection and isolation, aligning the model’s predictions with epidemiological theory.\n\nModel evaluation and validation are crucial for ensuring that interpretability results align with theoretical expectations and public health frameworks. These results are subsequently tested on an independent dataset to evaluate the model’s performance on unseen data, thereby confirming its robustness in predicting policy effectiveness across diverse settings.\n\nCounterfactual analysis is a vital component of public health policy evaluation, enabling the exploration of hypothetical scenarios. For instance, the model can simulate potential outcomes if a lockdown policy had not been implemented during a pandemic, helping researchers assess the policy’s direct and indirect effects on public health metrics such as infection rates, hospital admissions, and fatalities. This approach strengthens the model’s capacity to generate actionable insights for policymakers and public health officials. Figure 4 outlines the steps involved in applying machine learning to public health policy evaluation.\n\nSteps in the application of machine learning to public health policy evaluation.\n\n4.2. Application examples\n\nMachine learning has been effectively applied in various public health policy contexts to improve evaluation accuracy and inform policy decisions. A typical example is the use of machine learning techniques to assess the effectiveness of Brazil’s smoking cessation treatment policy, which combines theory-driven public health models with data analysis. By analyzing records from 1,202 patients, key variables such as drug use, nicotine dependence level, and relapse frequency were identified. These variables were selected based on the theoretical framework of smoking cessation interventions and clinical practice, ensuring the scientific validity and interpretability of the data and model. The study utilized multiple machine learning algorithms, including support vector machines (SVM) and random forests, for training and validation, ultimately selecting SVM as the best model, with a prediction accuracy of 72.6%. Additionally, the study calculated the odds ratio (OR) for the variables to quantify their association with smoking cessation success. For instance, the importance of drug use was consistent with the theoretical model (OR = 4.42). Based on this model, Massago et al. (32) developed a user-friendly tool that predicts the probability of treatment success based on patient characteristics, helping to optimize resource allocation and personalized intervention strategies. This provides a scientifically driven, theory- and data-based foundation for public health policy implementation.\n\nFurthermore, there are numerous other examples. For instance, Sarmiento et al. (33) highlighted the application of machine learning in COVID-19 clinical diagnosis, epidemiological variable analysis, and drug discovery through protein engineering. Kwak et al. (34) used machine learning to identify optimal COVID-19 control strategies, while Moosazadeh et al. (35) assessed the vulnerability of U.S. counties and the impact of various policies. Machine learning also plays a vital role in identifying high-risk populations, enabling targeted public health interventions. Clinical Decision Support Systems (CDSS) powered by machine learning assist clinicians in decision-making. Patel et al. (36) analyzed factors affecting maternal healthcare policies in India, providing insights for precision healthcare. Additionally, machine learning improves healthcare cost management, quality, and accessibility (37). In tobacco control, machine learning analyzes social media content to uncover factors affecting anti-smoking message dissemination and public engagement, aiding evidence-based policymaking (38, 39). Moreover, machine learning can also be applied to disease prediction and diagnosis, such as in cases of abnormal increase of transaminase in valproic acid-treated epilepsy (40) and colon cancer diagnosis and staging classification (41).\n\nTo implement machine learning in public health policy assessment, factors influencing health information systems (HIS) adoption must be addressed. Effective integration relies on system readiness to manage large-scale health data. A key determinant is the perceived ease of use and usefulness of HIS (42). Moreover, healthcare facility size and structure moderate adoption; larger hospitals possess resources and capacity for advanced technologies, whereas smaller ones face budget, expertise, and infrastructure constraints. These challenges shape machine learning adoption, especially in resource-limited settings.\n\n5. Limitations and future directions of machine learning in public health policy impact assessment\n\nIn light of the data challenges presented by the era of big data, machine learning can significantly broaden the applicability of traditional public health policy effect assessments by introducing numerous new methods and application scenarios. However, this approach also has certain limitations in the context of public health policy effect evaluation, which will be examined in this section. Based on these discussions, we will propose directions for the future development of public health policy effect assessments and machine learning methodologies.\n\n5.1. Limitations of machine learning in public health policy impact assessment\n\nAs previously noted, machine learning addresses the mis-specification issues inherent in traditional public health policy effect assessment methods through its data-driven approach. However, the complexity of these models can lead to difficulties in result interpretation. Machine learning models are generally classified as either white-box or black-box models (43). White-box models, such as linear regression and single decision trees, provide relatively straightforward mappings from inputs to outputs, making them easier to understand but also more susceptible to mis-specification. In contrast, black-box models—including neural networks, support vector machines, and random forests—enhance model accuracy by capturing intricate variable relationships. Nonetheless, the use of black-box models introduces a range of new challenges. Scholars often understand only the inputs and outputs of these models, lacking insight into the specific decision-making processes, parameter settings, and feature processing that occur internally. This lack of transparency complicates the interpretation and validation of the models, potentially rendering the derived conclusions less meaningful due to their inability to be reasonably interpreted (44). Therefore, achieving a balance between data-driven approaches and theory-supported relationships to ensure model interpretability and credibility poses a significant challenge for machine learning in the realm of public health policy evaluation.\n\nAs previously discussed, the advent of big data enables the application of machine learning methods that do not rely on specific models or functional forms. Instead, these methods leverage large-scale datasets to train the model, allowing the data itself to reveal the underlying functional relationships and facilitating a transition from theory-driven to data-driven assessments of public health policy effects. However, this data-driven approach can also introduce data bias into machine learning evaluations of public health policy. On one hand, systematic biases may arise during the data collection process, leading to the underestimation or overestimation of certain groups or characteristics within the training data. Such biases may stem from socioeconomic factors, limitations in technical access, or flaws in data collection methodologies (48). For instance, if certain patients lack access to healthcare resources due to poverty or the digital divide, their representation in the training data may be inadequate, resulting in their underrepresentation in public health policy assessments. This data collection bias can reflect existing societal inequalities and disparities, introducing distortions in machine learning models that hinder accurate assessments of policy effects on these groups. On the other hand, data-driven approaches may inadvertently perpetuate historical data biases that reinforce past inequalities and social injustices. If historical data contains biases or reflects unequal treatment of certain groups, machine learning models may internalize these biases, leading to unfair predictions in public health policy evaluations. For example, if a particular group has historically experienced discriminatory treatment in healthcare, the model may disproportionately emphasize the negative aspects of this group while neglecting their positive attributes, thus rendering public health policy effect assessments incomplete and unjust.\n\nLarge-scale public health datasets contain a wealth of sensitive information, and the application of machine learning models can raise significant data privacy and ethical concerns during the processing of this data. Data privacy issues primarily arise from the presence of sensitive information within these datasets, such as individuals’ identities, health statuses, and lifestyles. When this information is utilized for public health policy evaluation, there is a potential risk of misuse, which could result in targeting individuals, discriminatory decision-making, and privacy violations. Furthermore, machine learning models may inadvertently lead to information leakage while processing high-dimensional, unstructured public health data, thereby jeopardizing individual privacy. Additionally, the potential misuse of data represents a serious ethical issue. Once public health data is collected, there is a risk that it may be used for unauthorized purposes or combined with other datasets to extract additional information. This shift in purpose can threaten individual rights and provoke privacy and ethical controversies.\n\n5.2. Future directions of public health policy impact assessment and machine learning methods\n\nAs noted earlier, theory-driven approaches often fail to capture the complex, nonlinear relationships in public health data, while data-driven black-box models reduce interpretability. To optimize the use of public health data and machine learning methods, future research should adopt a combined “data-driven and theory-driven” framework. Theory provides a priori knowledge on public health variables, guiding the construction of data-driven models. Integrating theoretical frameworks during model development allows for more targeted model selection and construction, enhancing interpretability and credibility. For example, Cao et al. (45) used a theory-driven approach to study geographic factors influencing healthcare expenditures, offering insights for policy interventions. A data-driven approach can also validate theoretical assumptions by comparing the results of theory-guided and data-driven models. This comparison can assess the alignment of theoretical frameworks with real-world data, providing a more comprehensive understanding of their applicability and limitations. Moreover, the integration of theory and machine learning fosters innovation in public health theory through predictive analysis (46). By revealing previously unrecognized patterns, machine learning can inspire new theoretical perspectives and guide future research directions.\n\nTo mitigate data collection bias in big data-driven machine learning for public health policy assessment, a multilevel strategy is essential. Enhancing the quality and diversity of data collection across populations can reduce biases from socioeconomic factors, technological limitations, and flawed methods. Integrating diverse data sources, such as electronic health records, demographic surveys, and social media, improves representativeness, reducing the risk of misestimating certain groups. Bias detection tools like Fairness Indicators and IBM AI Fairness 360 can help identify disparities in data coverage and model outputs. A transparent, accountable data collection process is vital, supported by clear standards, privacy protections, and open data-sharing principles. Adopting FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable) principles ensures equitable data practices. Strengthened collaboration with community organizations and stakeholders further ensures comprehensive representation of diverse health needs. To address the impact of historical data on models, data balancing techniques such as SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique) and reweighting can correct biases by focusing on underrepresented populations during training. Combined with continuous fairness assessments, these techniques ensure model predictions align with public health policy equity goals. The specific application steps for methods such as Fairness Indicators, IBM AI Fairness 360 (AIF360), and SMOTE are outlined in the Table 2.\n\nSteps and techniques for detecting and addressing bias and inequality.\n\nAddressing data privacy and ethics in public health requires technical, legal, and social strategies. Differential privacy techniques, like those used by the U.S. Census Bureau in 2020, protect individual data by adding noise while enabling trend analysis (47). Advanced encryption, such as homomorphic encryption and secure multi-party computation frameworks like OpenMined, safeguards privacy during data processing. These methods balance privacy with analytical utility, proving effective in public health. Legal frameworks like the EU’s GDPR and U.S. HIPAA enforce data protection through consent requirements and privacy protocols. Institutions such as the UK’s Information Commissioner’s Office and independent review boards (IRBs) strengthen oversight and ethical compliance. Social engagement, through programs like the U.S. All of Us Research Program and community advisory boards, ensures accountability. Participatory workshops, citizen juries, media, and NGOs, like Privacy International, promote transparency, address privacy concerns, and advocate for ethical practices.\n\nTo enhance the accuracy and reliability of machine learning models in public health policy evaluations, it is crucial to employ robust validation and benchmarking strategies. Validation can be achieved using standard performance metrics, including precision, recall, and the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC-ROC). Furthermore, cross-validation techniques, such as k-fold cross-validation, help assess a model’s generalizability across different data subsets. Benchmarking involves utilizing standardized datasets that reflect the scope of public health policies, enabling comparative evaluations of various machine learning approaches. For instance, public datasets like health insurance claims or national epidemiological surveys offer a consistent baseline for model performance assessment. Combining these strategies ensures the robustness of machine learning applications while promoting transparency and reproducibility in policy evaluations.\n\n6. Conclusion and discussion\n\nCurrent empirical research in public health primarily focuses on evaluating the effects of public health policies. Scientific policy evaluation helps decision-makers understand the real impact of policy implementation, identify potential issues and deficiencies, and provide critical support for policy adjustments and improvements. This paper summarizes the principles, applicability, and specific model settings of three traditional public health policy evaluation methods: the difference-in-differences method, regression discontinuity design, and synthetic control method. It also examines the challenges these methods face in the era of big data, including unstructured health data, large-scale data processing, and model-related issues such as misspecification, multicollinearity, and overfitting. In response, this paper explores how machine learning addresses these challenges. Machine learning can handle unstructured health data and large-scale data more effectively, while resolving limitations in traditional models. Specifically, it corrects model misspecification through data-driven approaches, mitigates multicollinearity by reducing high-dimensional models, and tackles overfitting through regularization techniques. This enhances the scope, analytical dimensions, and practical value of public health policy evaluation.\n\nHowever, machine learning also introduces new challenges in public health policy evaluation, as outlined in this paper: black-box models hinder result interpretation, data bias risks reinforcing historical health inequalities, and data privacy and ethical concerns emerge. Therefore, relying solely on machine learning for public health policy evaluation is limited and requires integration with theoretical and practical insights from the public health domain. This paper proposes several strategies for advancing the use of machine learning in public health policy evaluation: combining data-driven and theory-driven approaches to enhance model interpretability, developing a multi-level data strategy to address data bias and the perpetuation of historical health inequalities, and integrating technical measures, legal frameworks, and social oversight to safeguard data privacy and ensure ethical use.\n\nPractical integration requires developing hybrid models that combine machine learning’s data exploration strengths with established theoretical frameworks. Effective collaboration between data scientists and public health experts is crucial. For instance, jointly developing validation frameworks based on epidemiological theories can enhance the interpretability of machine learning applications. Additionally, pilot studies comparing purely data-driven and hybrid models can assess their effectiveness and feasibility across various health policy contexts. Implementing multi-level data strategies requires comprehensive data governance frameworks. Public health agencies can collaborate with community organizations to ensure diverse representation in data collection. The feasibility of real-world applications can be enhanced by leveraging federated learning, which enables data sharing across institutions while maintaining privacy, thus overcoming challenges in creating unified datasets. A practical step is forming interdisciplinary committees of legal experts, technologists, and public health practitioners to oversee the implementation of safeguards. These committees could create use-case templates for ethical machine learning applications in health policy, addressing data privacy concerns with tools like differential privacy algorithms. Public outreach initiatives can increase transparency and build trust among stakeholders.\n\nFunding Statement\n\nThe author(s) declare that financial support was received for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.

Introduction\n\nCausal inference is a statistical method that aims to provide evidence about the impact of an intervention on a system, and it has been widely employed in empirical research to assess the evaluation of public health policies [1]. In the case of public health policy impact evaluation, the core of causal inference is to provide a reliable answer to the following question: “What would have happened in the absence of the policy?”. This question represents the counterfactual scenario (contrary to the fact), which cannot be directly observed [2]. Therefore, it is necessary to estimate the potential outcomes in the situation where the policy had not been implemented, by comparing a group of individuals subject to the policy (treatment group) with another group that is not subject to it (control group). If the selected groups have similar characteristics, it is possible to estimate the policy impact effect without bias [3,4,5].\n\nOverall, researchers use data from quasi-experimental design research (ecological studies) to investigate the causal effect of public health policies. One of the challenges of causal inference in ecological studies is the presence of imbalances in covariates, which affect both the treatment and the outcome, acting as confounders [6]. In this context, a set of assumptions is required to obtain unbiased causal inference: stability (the potential outcomes for any unit are not affected by other units’ treatment levels), consistency (the observed outcome is equal to the potential outcome at any treatment level), exchangeability (the potential outcomes are independent of the treatment for any treatment level), and positivity (subgroups with similar characteristics have a non-zero probability of being in any intervention level) [7].\n\nHowever, the large number of covariates and the non-randomized nature of subject groups in quasi-experimental studies pose significant challenges to causal inference [8]. Confounding factors, selection bias, and measurement errors are typically bottlenecks in validating causal inference models [9]. To overcome these issues, propensity score (PS)-based methods are often used to reduce bias in causal effect estimation [4]. PS is a conditional probability of receiving a specific treatment (or an intervention, e.g., the implementation of a health policy) in a quasi-experimental design. Additionally, PS incorporates observed covariables potentially related to the treatment under analysis and/or its outcomes in a single score [10,11].\n\nThe PS approach results in a dimensionality reduction, since a single variable is obtained from a given vector of observed covariables [12]. Thus, all covariates are incorporated into the PS, offering a way to achieve more balanced groups through the PS matching of the treatment and control groups. Causal inference can then be made by balancing on the PS rather than on all the covariates. Finally, given an exposed and an unexposed individual with a similar PS, the assignment of treatment is independent of unobserved confounders [8]. In the extended literature, logistic regression has been broadly employed to estimate the PS [12,13,14,15]. However, logistic regression requires assumptions regarding variable selection, the distributions of variables, and the specification of interactions [16]. In this context, machine learning (ML) algorithms are an alternative to logistic regression in estimating the PS [17].\n\nML stands as a prominent application of artificial intelligence (AI) and has been used to obtain insights in different fields. In public health, several ML algorithms have been employed to predict clinical outcomes using data from medical imaging and electronic health records (EHRs), for instance [18]. However, despite the widespread use of predictive ML models in clinical medicine, the application of AI to assess the impact of public health policies on population health and health inequalities has been less reported [2,6,19].\n\nThis scoping review aims to map the empirical literature concerning the use of ML algorithms for PS estimation in the causal inference evaluation of public health policies. Our goal is to identify ML algorithms that can be applied to estimate the PS, as well as the modeling and evaluation strategies involved. The key contribution of this study is to provide a comprehensive overview of the potential use of ML techniques in PS estimation and their applicability to real-world public health data.\n\nTo our knowledge, few reviews have focused specifically on the use of ML in causal inference related to public health policy, differing from this scoping review in terms of their objectives and scope. The review conducted by Westreich et al. (2010) [12] explores ML alternatives to logistic regression, primarily offering theoretical explanations of the models. Mooney and Pejaver (2018) [9] address several key issues around big data in public health, including a brief discussion on causal inference. Cheng et al. (2022) [17] focus on reviewing causal theories and methodologies, and on benchmarking a fundamental task in causal inference.\n\nIn this scoping review, we provide an analysis of the use of ML algorithms to estimate the PS in health policy evaluation in empirical studies. Moreover, understanding how these models have been developed, identifying knowledge gaps, and recognizing limitations might guide future research in causal inference, providing important contributions towards a better understanding of causal inference powered by ML algorithms.\n\n2. Materials and Methods\n\nThis scoping review follows the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for Scoping Reviews (PRISMA-ScR) guidelines [20], and the study protocol was registered on the Open Science Framework (doi.org/10.17605/OSF.IO/WTMGX).\n\n2.1. Research Question\n\nThe research question was developed using the PCC (Participants, Concept, and Context) framework. The context involves the evaluation of public health policies, while the concept focuses on the use of machine learning (ML) algorithms for propensity score (PS) estimation. The participants are undefined and refer to the general population under a specific health policy. Thus, the research question is as follows: “What machine learning algorithms have been used to estimate propensity scores in the context of health policy impact evaluation?”. Our goal is to comprehensively scope out all ML algorithms that have been employed in causal inference for evaluating health policies worldwide.\n\n2.2. Eligibility Criteria\n\nThe inclusion criteria covered all articles that use any ML algorithm to estimate the PS in the context of health policy impact evaluation. There were no restrictions on the publication year, language, or location. The exclusion criteria were as follows: (1) studies outside the domain of public policy evaluation; (2) studies that did not employ any ML algorithm to estimate PS; (3) studies focused on a specific clinical care or disease application; (4) those with missing methodology or results; (5) studies comprising book chapters or conference papers; and (6) studies where the full text was not available.\n\n2.3. Information Sources and Search Strategy\n\nThe search strategy comprised peer-reviewed literature database, gray literature, and reference searches. The following databases were selected: PubMed, EMBASE, ACM Digital Library, IEEE Explore, LILACS, Web of Science, Scopus, and Compendex. Gray literature search tools included ProQuest and Google Scholar. The Google Scholar search was based on the first 100 most relevant studies. The search strategy was developed in collaboration with an academic librarian and adapted for each database (Appendix A). The search was conducted in 6 July 2023. Additionally, the reference lists of included articles were screened to identify potential studies. The references obtained from the search strategy were managed using EndNote Web, which automatically removed duplicate articles.\n\n2.4. Study Selection Process\n\nThe study selection process and decision tracking were managed using the Rayyan review tool. Two independent reviewers (LL and LW) conducted the screening in a double-blinded process, following two sequential phases. In the first phase, the selection process was based on reading the title, abstract, and author keywords. Studies which met the eligibility criteria were selected and moved to the next phase. In the second phase, full-text reading was undertaken, applying the inclusion and exclusion criteria to obtain the final set of studies (phase 2). In both phases, disagreements were resolved through consensus, and in cases of persisting discrepancies, a third reviewer (VR) was consulted.\n\n2.5. Data Extraction and Synthesis\n\nData from each included study were extracted independently by two reviewers (LL and LW). The extracted data included general study characteristics (country, health policy or program under analysis, year, and data source), model development (features, outcomes, and ML algorithms used) and evaluation aspects (performance metrics and main conclusions). The data charting process was conducted manually. In order to minimize potential errors, a calibration study was carried out as indicated in the PRISMA-ScR guidelines [20]. Disagreements were resolved through consensus. The results were synthesized through a narrative approach, reporting on the extent of different ML models for PS estimation in causal impact of health policies, the methods employed, and whether bias was identified.\n\n3. Results\n\n3.1. Study Selection\n\nThe search retrieved 3018 studies from the selected database and 185 studies from the gray literature. A total of 815 duplicated articles were automatically excluded, leaving 2203 documents remaining. After screening phase 1, based on reading the title, abstract, and author keywords, 2141 studies were excluded. In screening phase 2, 55 articles were excluded and 7 studies met the inclusion criteria after full-text reading. The screening process is presented in Figure 1, and data extracted from all the included studies are summarized in Table 1.\n\nPRISMA flow diagram of literature search and selection criteria.\n\nData summary of included studies on machine learning used for propensity score estimation.\n\n3.2. Machine Learning Algorithms\n\nThe ML algorithms used in the screened studies included random forest [22,24,27], causal forest [21,25], Bayesian additive regression trees [22,26], neural networks [24,27], gradient boosting [24,27], generalized linear models [27], XGBoost [27], boosted regression trees [23], and support vector machines [24]. In addition, three studies compared the results of the machine learning algorithms with statistical logistic regression methods [22,24,25].\n\nAll the studies reviewed provided some discussion regarding the use of ML algorithms for assessing the impact of health policies. The main advantages highlighted by the authors included efficiency in handling high-dimensional data, the ability to capture the non-linear relationships among the variables, improved covariate balance, and reduction in bias in cases of model misspecification. The authors of most of the articles also discussed some of the limitations of their studies.\n\n3.3. Model Development\n\nIn general, sociodemographic variables such as age, gender, education level, and household income, were frequently used. The number of features considered in each study varied between 5 and 33, with 57% of the studies using less than 10 independent variables. Fewer authors described how missing data were handled [22,27], reported how overfitting was prevented [24], provided the algorithm’s hyperparameters [23,25], and evaluated performance metrics [24,27]. Additionally, a sensitivity analysis was performed and evaluated only in three selected studies [22,24,27]. Sensitivity analysis approaches are recommended in causality studies to assess the robustness of causal effects in the presence of potential unmeasured or uncontrolled confounders [28,29].\n\n4. Discussion\n\nThis scoping review provides a comprehensive overview of the current use of ML algorithms for PS estimation in health policy impact evaluation studies worldwide. A total of seven studies were included in the review process, evidencing the incipient application of ML for this purpose. Despite the growing presence of artificial intelligence in health sciences [1,9], it is well known that statistical models are widely employed to estimate propensity scores in causal inference studies. Among them, logistic regression is preferrable due to its familiarity among researchers and ease of implementation, often being considered the state-of-the-art model [12].\n\nIn their study, Garcia et al. (2023) [27] proposed the use of ML to estimate the impact of national government expenditure on reducing infant mortality across several countries. Although the study does not focus on a specific health policy, the authors sought to investigate the decisions made by governments to improve public health in their countries. The method employed was based on the use of the Super Learner algorithm to estimate the generalized propensity score (GPS), guiding the results to a reduction in the coefficient of variation of the weights. The authors compared the results with other GPS estimation methods and found that Super Learner had the highest coefficient of variation of weights. Moreover, specific performance metrics of Super Learner were not provided, making it impossible to assess the feasibility of this approach.\n\nBayesian additive regression trees (BARTs) and boosted regression trees were used by Wink Junior et al. (2022) [26] and Ladhania et al. (2021) [23], respectively, to evaluate the impact of health policies on emergency care units. Although both studies discussed the potential advantages of ML in causal inference, the authors did not provide a detailed evaluation of the selected models. Likewise, a causal forest was applied in two screened studies [21,25]. However, both analyses did not show or mention any performance metrics of the models, and also did not perform a sensitivity analysis.\n\nML applications can be particularly effective in modeling the association of outcomes with covariates, especially when dealing with high-dimensional data [2]. In addition, ML algorithms can implicitly address interactions and non-linearities, which might result in improvements in PS estimation, as logistic regression assumes linearity between covariates and the log odds of the outcome. When there are implicit non-linearities in the system, the use of logistic regression might result in a poor model fit and, in turn, a biased effect estimation [12,16]. In this context, Westreich et al. (2010) [12] discussed the use of ML for PS estimation, highlighting boosting techniques and decision trees as alternatives to logistic regression. However, the main drawback of these algorithms is their “black box” nature, which can make the etiological interpretation difficult.\n\nLee, Lessler, and Stuart (2010) [16] explored the use of ML algorithms to estimate the PS in a hypothetical study in order to evaluate the robustness of non-parametric techniques compared to logistic regression. The authors evaluated the performance of basic off-the-shelf versions of ML, reducing the complexity of implementation, across scenarios with different degrees of non-linearity as well as using small, medium, and large-size datasets. According to their findings, the classification and regression trees (CARTs), random forests, and boosted CARTs outperformed logistic regression, regardless of the sample size or the extent of the non-linearity. These results suggest that, despite ML algorithms usually being used with larger datasets, they can also be satisfactorily used in smaller datasets and less complex systems.\n\nTwo eligible studies analyzed different ML algorithms, providing comparison evaluations among the selected models and logistic regressions. Maciel and Duarte (2022) [24] compared the accuracy and sensitivity of gradient boosting, random forests, neural networks, support vector machines, and logistic regression models. According to their findings, all the models had a similar accuracy, ranging from 74.2% to 76.5%. However, gradient boosting had the highest sensitivity (93.5%), indicating a greater robustness to potential unobserved confounders [30]. On the other hand, both logistic regression and support vector machines had the lowest sensitivity (76.5%). Costello et al. (2021) [22] evaluated random forests and Bayesian additive regression trees, as well as logistic regression, for propensity score estimation. The authors support their results on the comparison of the estimation effects and the sensitivity analysis, regardless of them not providing appropriate ML performance metrics.\n\nOverall, the findings suggest similar results among parametric and non-parametric models, demonstrating a relative robustness to unmeasured confounders. The satisfactory performance of logistic regression in both Maciel and Duarte’s (2022) [24] and Costello et al.’s (2021) [22] studies may argue against the use of ML algorithms for PS estimation for health policy evaluation. Considering the more demanding implementation of ML also in terms of computational time, Cannas and Arpino (2019) [6] pointed out that the use of ML over logistic regression may not be worthwhile if logistic regression is sufficient for achieving a good covariate balance.\n\nThe results of the selected studies often fell short in terms of model evaluation. Many studies did not report the hyperparameter selection process, strategies to avoid overfitting, or any performance metric, which limits their critical appraisal or comparison with parametric approaches. As a result, the discussion of the ML models is restricted to their use and application as an alternative to logistic regression. Consequently, the discussions on ML models were often restricted to their application as alternatives to logistic regression. This limitation hinders the comprehensive comparison of different ML algorithms used for PS estimation or the evaluation of different causal inference models across various studies.\n\nCheng et al. (2022) [17] highlighted the lack of benchmark resources for model evaluation in causal inference studies. This gap makes it challenging to integrate both ML and causal inference techniques. Moreover, tuning hyperparameters and validation processes are crucial to ensure reliable results from ML algorithms. In the context of causal inference, ML tuning is not straightforward, as optimality should refer to some measure of covariate balance required for unbiased effect estimation, rather than to goodness-of-fit measures, as is commonly performed [6]. Frequently, cross-validation techniques have been suggested for this purpose and they are recommended for future studies.\n\n5. Conclusions and Future Directions\n\nThis scoping review acknowledges that some studies may have been omitted due the restrictions on the selected databases. In addition, the inclusion criteria were restricted to studies that specifically focused on health policy evaluation. Consequently, this review does not cover the broader use of machine learning in causal inference, potentially introducing selection bias. Since many studies did not report the performance metrics of the algorithms, this review primarily aimed to discuss the state of the art of the use of machine learning for propensity score estimation, rather than providing a comprehensive evaluation of its feasibility and advantages compared to parametric methods. Despite these challenges, the results of this scoping review highlighted key directions for future research. When dealing with high-dimensional covariates, a parametric approach such as logistic regression may fail to address the interaction effects of all the predictors. In this case, ML algorithms can offer an alternative to overcome this issue. However, if the system under analysis involves few covariates, it is necessary to evaluate whether the use of ML algorithms over logistic regression, for instance, brings significant benefits, due to the model complexity and computational costs. In summary, while the application of ML algorithms remains limited, there is clear potential for further exploration. More primary studies are needed to better understand the precision of AI in health policy evaluation. Overall, ML offers promising opportunities to enhance the evaluation of health policies by incorporating high-dimensional data and non-linear effects, thus enriching our understanding of policy interventions.\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nThe authors thank Karyn M.
